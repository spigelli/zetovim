  -> file_name: string
```

 Returns the cache file name

@*param* `name` — can be a module name, or a file name

## eq


```lua
function Loader.eq(h1: CacheHash, h2: CacheHash)
  -> boolean
```

 Checks whether two cache hashes are the same based on:
 * file size
 * mtime in seconds
 * mtime in nanoseconds

## get_rtp


```lua
function Loader.get_rtp()
  -> rtp: string[]
  2. updated: boolean
```

 Gets the rtp excluding after directories.
 The result is cached, and will be updated if the runtime path changes.
 When called from a fast event, the cached value will be returned.

## load


```lua
function Loader.load(modpath: string, opts?: { hash: CacheHash, mode: "b"|"bt"|"t", env: table })
  -> function?
  2. error_message: string?
```

 Loads the given module path using the cache

@*param* `opts` — (table|nil) Options for loading the module:

    - hash: (table) the hash of the file to load if it is already known. (defaults to `vim.loop.fs_stat({modpath})`)
    - mode: (string) the mode to load the module with. "b"|"t"|"bt" (defaults to `nil`)
    - env: (table) the environment to load the module in. (defaults to `nil`)

## loader


```lua
function Loader.loader(modname: string)
  -> string|function
```

 The `package.loaders` loader for lua files using the cache.

@*param* `modname` — module name

## loader_lib


```lua
function Loader.loader_lib(modname: string)
  -> string|function
```

 The `package.loaders` loader for libs

@*param* `modname` — module name

## loadfile


```lua
function Loader.loadfile(filename?: string, mode?: "b"|"bt"|"t", env?: table, hash?: CacheHash)
  -> function?
  2. error_message: string?
```

 `loadfile` using the cache
 luacheck: ignore 312

```lua
mode:
    | "b"
    | "t"
    | "bt"
```

## lsmod


```lua
function Loader.lsmod(path: string)
  -> table<string, ModuleInfo>
```

 Return the top-level `/lua/*` modules for this path

@*param* `path` — path to check for top-level lua modules

## normalize


```lua
function Loader.normalize(path: any)
  -> string
```

 slightly faster/different version than vim.fs.normalize
 we also need to have it here, since the loader will load vim.fs

## read


```lua
function Loader.read(name: string)
  -> CacheEntry?
```

 Loads the cache entry for a given module or file

@*param* `name` — module name or filename

## write


```lua
function Loader.write(name: string, entry: CacheEntry)
```

 Saves the cache entry for a given module or file

@*param* `name` — module name or filename

# uv


The [luv](https://github.com/luvit/luv/) project provides access to the multi-platform support library
[libuv](http://libuv.org/) in Lua code. It was primarily developed for the [luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit/) project as
the built-in `uv` module, but can be used in other Lua environments.

More information about the core libuv library can be found at the original
[libuv documentation page](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/).

### TCP Echo Server Example

Here is a small example showing a TCP echo server:

```lua
local uv = require("luv") -- "luv" when stand-alone, "uv" in luvi apps

local server = uv.new_tcp()
server:bind("127.0.0.1", 1337)
server:listen(128, function (err)
  assert(not err, err)
  local client = uv.new_tcp()
  server:accept(client)
  client:read_start(function (err, chunk)
    assert(not err, err)
    if chunk then
      client:write(chunk)
    else
      client:shutdown()
      client:close()
    end
  end)
end)
print("TCP server listening at 127.0.0.1 port 1337")
uv.run() -- an explicit run call is necessary outside of luvit
```

### Module Layout

The luv library contains a single Lua module referred to hereafter as `uv` for
simplicity. This module consists mostly of functions with names corresponding to
their original libuv versions. For example, the libuv function `uv_tcp_bind` has
a luv version at `uv.tcp_bind`. Currently, only two non-function fields exists:
`uv.constants` and `uv.errno`, which are tables.

### Functions vs Methods

In addition to having simple functions, luv provides an optional method-style
API. For example, `uv.tcp_bind(server, host, port)` can alternatively be called
as `server:bind(host, port)`. Note that the first argument `server` becomes the
object and `tcp_` is removed from the function name. Method forms are
documented below where they exist.

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous Functions

Functions that accept a callback are asynchronous. These functions may
immediately return results to the caller to indicate their initial status, but
their final execution is deferred until at least the next libuv loop iteration.
After completion, their callbacks are executed with any results passed to it.

Functions that do not accept a callback are synchronous. These functions
immediately return their results to the caller.

Some (generally FS and DNS) functions can behave either synchronously or
asynchronously. If a callback is provided to these functions, they behave
asynchronously; if no callback is provided, they behave synchronously.

### Pseudo-Types

Some unique types are defined. These are not actual types in Lua, but they are
used here to facilitate documenting consistent behavior:
- `fail`: an assertable `nil, string, string` tuple (see [Error handling][])
- `callable`: a `function`; or a `table` or `userdata` with a `__call`
  metamethod
- `buffer`: a `string` or a sequential `table` of `string`s
- `threadargs`: variable arguments (`...`) of type `nil`, `boolean`, `number`,
  `string`, or `userdata`


## accept


```lua
function uv.accept(stream: uv_stream_t, client_stream: uv_stream_t)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


This call is used in conjunction with `uv.listen()` to accept incoming
connections. Call this function after receiving a callback to accept the
connection.

When the connection callback is called it is guaranteed that this function
will complete successfully the first time. If you attempt to use it more than
once, it may fail. It is suggested to only call this function once per
connection call.

```lua
server:listen(128, function (err)
  local client = uv.new_tcp()
  server:accept(client)
end)
```


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## async_send


```lua
function uv.async_send(async: uv_async_t, ...uv.aliases.threadargs)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Wakeup the event loop and call the async handle's callback.

**Note**: It's safe to call this function from any thread. The callback will be
called on the loop thread.

**Warning**: libuv will coalesce calls to `uv.async_send(async)`, that is, not
every call to it will yield an execution of the callback. For example: if
`uv.async_send()` is called 5 times in a row before the callback is called, the
callback will only be called once. If `uv.async_send()` is called again after
the callback was called, it will be called again.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## available_parallelism


```lua
function uv.available_parallelism()
  -> integer
```


Returns an estimate of the default amount of parallelism a program should use. Always returns a non-zero value.

On Linux, inspects the calling thread’s CPU affinity mask to determine if it has been pinned to specific CPUs.

On Windows, the available parallelism may be underreported on systems with more than 64 logical CPUs.

On other platforms, reports the number of CPUs that the operating system considers to be online.

## backend_fd


```lua
function uv.backend_fd()
  -> integer|nil
```


Get backend file descriptor. Only kqueue, epoll, and event ports are supported.
This can be used in conjunction with `uv.run("nowait")` to poll in one thread
and run the event loop's callbacks in another

**Note**: Embedding a kqueue fd in another kqueue pollset doesn't work on all
platforms. It's not an error to add the fd but it never generates events.

## backend_timeout


```lua
function uv.backend_timeout()
  -> integer
```


Get the poll timeout. The return value is in milliseconds, or -1 for no timeout.

## cancel


```lua
function uv.cancel(req: uv_fs_t|uv_getaddrinfo_t|uv_getnameinfo_t)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Cancel a pending request. Fails if the request is executing or has finished
executing. Only cancellation of `uv_fs_t`, `uv_getaddrinfo_t`,
`uv_getnameinfo_t` and `uv_work_t` requests is currently supported.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## chdir


```lua
function uv.chdir(cwd: string)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Sets the current working directory with the string `cwd`.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## check_start


```lua
function uv.check_start(check: uv_check_t, callback: fun())
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Start the handle with the given callback.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## check_stop


```lua
function uv.check_stop(check: uv_check_t)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Stop the handle, the callback will no longer be called.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## close


```lua
function uv.close(handle: uv_handle_t, callback?: function)
```


Request handle to be closed. `callback` will be called asynchronously after this
call. This MUST be called on each handle before memory is released.

Handles that wrap file descriptors are closed immediately but `callback` will
still be deferred to the next iteration of the event loop. It gives you a chance
to free up any resources associated with the handle.

In-progress requests, like `uv_connect_t` or `uv_write_t`, are cancelled and
have their callbacks called asynchronously with `ECANCELED`.

@*param* `handle` —  `userdata` for sub-type of `uv_handle_t`

## constants


```lua
uv.constants
```

## cpu_info


```lua
function uv.cpu_info()
  -> uv.aliases.cpu_info|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Returns information about the CPU(s) on the system as a table of tables for each
CPU found.

## cwd


```lua
function uv.cwd()
  -> string|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Returns the current working directory.

## disable_stdio_inheritance


```lua
function uv.disable_stdio_inheritance()
```


Disables inheritance for file descriptors / handles that this process inherited
from its parent. The effect is that child processes spawned by this process
don't accidentally inherit these handles.
It is recommended to call this function as early in your program as possible,
before the inherited file descriptors can be closed or duplicated.

**Note:** This function works on a best-effort basis: there is no guarantee that
libuv can discover all file descriptors that were inherited. In general it does
a better job on Windows than it does on Unix.

## errno


```lua
uv.errno
```


A table value which exposes error constants as a map, where the key is the
error name (without the `UV_` prefix) and its value is a negative number.
See Libuv's "Error constants" page for further details.
(https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/errors.html#error-constants)


## exepath


```lua
function uv.exepath()
  -> string|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Returns the executable path.

## fileno


```lua
function uv.fileno(handle: uv_handle_t)
  -> integer|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Gets the platform dependent file descriptor equivalent.

The following handles are supported: TCP, pipes, TTY, UDP and poll. Passing any
other handle type will fail with `EINVAL`.

If a handle doesn't have an attached file descriptor yet or the handle itself
has been closed, this function will return `EBADF`.

**Warning**: Be very careful when using this function. libuv assumes it's in
control of the file descriptor so any change to it may lead to malfunction.

@*param* `handle` — `userdata` for sub-type of `uv_handle_t`

## fs_access


```lua
function uv.fs_access(path: string, mode: uv.aliases.fs_access_mode, callback: fun(err: string|nil, permission: boolean|nil))
  -> uv_fs_t
```


Equivalent to `access(2)` on Unix. Windows uses `GetFileAttributesW()`. Access
`mode` can be an integer or a string containing `"R"` or `"W"` or `"X"`.

Returns `true` or `false` indicating access permission.


```lua
mode:
    | 'R' -- Tests for readbility.
    | 'W' -- Tests for writiblity.
    | 'X' -- Tests for executibility.
    | 'RW' -- Tests for readbility and writiblity.
    | 'RX' -- Tests for readbility and executibility.
    | 'WX' -- Tests for writiblity and executibility.
    | 'WRX' -- Tests for writiblity and readbility and executibility.

See below for available access `flags`.

**Note:** On Windows, libuv uses `CreateFileW` and thus the file is always
opened in binary mode. Because of this, the `O_BINARY` and `O_TEXT` flags are
not supported.


```lua
flags:
    | "r" -- Open file for reading.
          -- Fails if the file does not exist.
          -- Mode: O_RDONLY.
    | "rs" -- Open file for reading in synchronous mode.
           -- Instructs the operating system to bypass the local file system cache.
           -- This is primarily useful for opening files on NFS mounts as it allows you to
           -- skip the potentially stale local cache. It has a very real impact on I/O
           -- performance so don't use this flag unless you need it.
           -- Note that this doesn't turn this call into a synchronous blocking call.
           -- Mode: O_RDONLY + O_SYNC.
    | "sr" -- Same as `'rs'`.
    | "r+" -- Open file for reading and writing.
           -- Fails if the file does not exist.
           -- Mode: O_RDWR.
    | "rs+" -- Open file for reading and writing, telling the OS to open it synchronously.
            -- See notes for `'rs'` about using this with caution.
            -- Mode: O_RDWR + O_SYNC.
    | "sr+" -- Same as `'rs+'`.
    | "w" -- Open file for writing.
          -- The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).
          -- Mode: O_TRUNC + O_CREAT + O_WRONLY.
    | "wx" -- Open file for writing.
           -- Fails if the file exists.
           -- Mode: O_TRUNC + O_CREAT + O_WRONLY + O_EXCL.
    | "xw" -- Same as `'wx'`.
    | "w+" -- Open file for reading and writing.
           -- The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).
           -- Mode: O_TRUNC + O_CREAT + O_RDWR.
    | "wx+" -- Open file for reading and writing.
            -- Fails if file exists.
            -- Mode: O_TRUNC + O_CREAT + O_RDWR + O_EXCL.

    | "xa" -- Same as `'ax'`.
    | "a+" -- Open file for reading and appending.
           -- The file is created if it does not exist.
           -- Mode: O_APPEND + O_CREAT + O_RDWR.

            -- Mode: O_APPEND + O_CREAT + O_RDWR + O_EXCL
    | "xa+" -- Same as `'ax+'`.

  -> uv_fs_t
```


Opens path as a directory stream. Returns a handle that the user can pass to
`uv.fs_readdir()`. The `entries` parameter defines the maximum number of entries
that should be returned by each call to `uv.fs_readdir()`.

## fs_poll_getpath


```lua

  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Check the file at `path` for changes every `interval` milliseconds.

**Note:** For maximum portability, use multi-second intervals. Sub-second
intervals will not detect all changes on many file systems.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## fs_poll_stop


```lua
function uv.fs_poll_stop()
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Stop the handle, the callback will no longer be called.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## fs_read


```lua
function uv.fs_read(fd: integer, size: integer, offset: integer|nil, callback: fun(err: string|nil, data: string|nil))
  -> uv_fs_t
```


Equivalent to `preadv(2)`. Returns any data. An empty string indicates EOF.

If `offset` is nil or omitted, it will default to `-1`, which indicates 'use and update the current file offset.'

**Note:** When `offset` is >= 0, the current file offset will not be updated by the read.

## fs_readdir


```lua
function uv.fs_readdir(dir: luv_dir_t, callback: fun(err: string|nil, entries: uv.aliases.fs_readdir_entries|nil))
  -> uv_fs_t
```


Iterates over the directory stream `uv_dir_t` returned by a successful
`uv.fs_opendir()` call. A table of data tables is returned where the number
of entries `n` is equal to or less than the `entries` parameter used in
the associated `uv.fs_opendir()` call.

## fs_readlink


```lua
function uv.fs_readlink(path: string, callback: fun(err: string|nil, path: string|nil))
  -> uv_fs_t
```

  -> uv_fs_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Equivalent to `scandir(3)`, with a slightly different API. Returns a handle that
the user can pass to `uv.fs_scandir_next()`.

**Note:** This function can be used synchronously or asynchronously. The request
userdata is always synchronously returned regardless of whether a callback is
provided and the same userdata is passed to the callback if it is provided.

## fs_scandir_next


```lua
function uv.fs_scandir_next(fs: uv_fs_t)
  -> string|nil
  2. string|nil
  3. err_name: string?
  4. err_msg: string?
```


Called on a `uv_fs_t` returned by `uv.fs_scandir()` to get the next directory
entry data as a `name, type` pair. When there are no more entries, `nil` is
returned.

**Note:** This function only has a synchronous version. See `uv.fs_opendir` and
its related functions for an asynchronous version.

## fs_sendfile


```lua
function uv.fs_sendfile(out_fd: integer, in_fd: integer, in_offset: integer, size: integer, callback: fun(err: string|nil, bytes: integer|nil))

function uv.fs_symlink(path: string, new_path: string, flags: integer|uv.aliases.fs_symlink_flags, callback: fun(err: string|nil, success: boolean|nil))
  -> uv_fs_t
```


Equivalent to `symlink(2)`.
If the `flags` parameter is omitted, then the 3rd parameter will be treated as the `callback`.

## fs_unlink


```lua
function uv.fs_unlink(path: string, callback: fun(err: string|nil, success: boolean|nil))
  -> uv_fs_t
```


Equivalent to `unlink(2)`.

## fs_write


```lua
function uv.fs_write(fd: integer, data: uv.aliases.buffer, offset: integer|nil, callback: fun(err: string|nil, bytes: integer|nil))
  -> uv_fs_t
```


Equivalent to `pwritev(2)`. Returns the number of bytes written.

If `offset` is nil or omitted, it will default to `-1`, which indicates 'use and update the current file offset.'

**Note:** When `offset` is >= 0, the current file offset will not be updated by the write.

## get_constrained_memory


```lua
function uv.get_constrained_memory()
  -> integer
```


Gets the amount of memory available to the process in bytes based on limits
imposed by the OS. If there is no such constraint, or the constraint is unknown,
0 is returned. Note that it is not unusual for this value to be less than or
greater than the total system memory.

## get_free_memory


```lua
function uv.get_free_memory()
  -> integer
```


Returns the current free system memory in bytes.

## get_process_title

## hrtime


```lua
function uv.hrtime()
  -> integer
```


Returns a current high-resolution time in nanoseconds as a number. This is
relative to an arbitrary time in the past. It is not related to the time of day
and therefore not subject to clock drift. The primary use is for measuring
time between intervals.

## idle_start

  3. err_msg: string?
```


Retrieves a network interface identifier suitable for use in an IPv6 scoped
address. On Windows, returns the numeric `ifindex` as a string. On all other
platforms, `uv.if_indextoname()` is used.

## if_indextoname


```lua
function uv.if_indextoname(ifindex: integer)
  -> string|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?

is an array of address information where fields are `ip`, `family`, `netmask`,
`internal`, and `mac`.

## is_active


```lua
function uv.is_active(handle: uv_handle_t)
  -> boolean|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Returns `true` if the handle is active, `false` if it's inactive. What "active”
means depends on the type of handle:

 - A `uv_async_t` handle is always active and cannot be deactivated, except
 by closing it with `uv.close()`.

 - A `uv_pipe_t`, `uv_tcp_t`, `uv_udp_t`, etc. handle - basically
 any handle that deals with I/O - is active when it is doing something that
 involves I/O, like reading, writing, connecting, accepting new connections,
 etc.

 - A `uv_check_t`, `uv_idle_t`, `uv_timer_t`, etc. handle is active
 when it has been started with a call to `uv.check_start()`, `uv.idle_start()`,
 `uv.timer_start()` etc. until it has been stopped with a call to its
 respective stop function.

@*param* `handle` —  `userdata` for sub-type of `uv_handle_t`

## is_closing


```lua
function uv.is_closing(handle: uv_handle_t)
  -> boolean|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Returns `true` if the handle is closing or closed, `false` otherwise.

**Note**: This function should only be used between the initialization of the
handle and the arrival of the close callback.

@*param* `handle` —  `userdata` for sub-type of `uv_handle_t`

## is_readable

  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Sends the specified signal to the given PID.


```lua

## listen


```lua
function uv.listen(stream: uv_stream_t, backlog: integer, callback: fun(err?: string))
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Start listening for incoming connections. `backlog` indicates the number of
connections the kernel might queue, same as `listen(2)`. When a new incoming
connection is received the callback is called.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## loadavg


```lua
function uv.loadavg()
  -> number
  2. number
  3. number
```


Returns the load average as a triad. Not supported on Windows.

## loop_alive


```lua
function uv.loop_alive()
  -> boolean|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Returns `true` if there are referenced active handles, active requests, or
closing handles in the loop; otherwise, `false`.

## loop_close


```lua
function uv.loop_close()
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Closes all internal loop resources. In normal execution, the loop will
automatically be closed when it is garbage collected by Lua, so it is not
necessary to explicitly call `loop_close()`. Call this function only after the
loop has finished executing and all open handles and requests have been closed,
or it will return `EBUSY`.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## loop_configure


```lua
function uv.loop_configure(option: uv.aliases.loop_configure_option, ...any)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Set additional loop options. You should normally call this before the first call
to uv_run() unless mentioned otherwise.
Supported options:
- `"block_signal"`: Block a signal when polling for new events. The second argument
to loop_configure() is the signal name (as a lowercase string) or the signal number.
This operation is currently only implemented for `"sigprof"` signals, to suppress
unnecessary wakeups when using a sampling profiler. Requesting other signals will
fail with `EINVAL`.
- `"metrics_idle_time"`: Accumulate the amount of idle time the event loop spends
in the event provider. This option is necessary to use `metrics_idle_time()`.
An example of a valid call to this function is:
```lua
uv.loop_configure("block_signal", "sigprof")
```

**Note**: Be prepared to handle the `ENOSYS` error; it means the loop option is
not supported by the platform.


```lua
option:
    | 'block_signal' -- Block a signal when polling for new events.
                     -- The second argument to loop_configure() is the signal name (as a lowercase string) or the signal number.
                     -- This operation is currently only implemented for `"sigprof"` signals, to suppress unnecessary wakeups when using a sampling profiler.
                     -- Requesting other signals will fail with `EINVAL`.
    | 'metrics_idle_time' -- Accumulate the amount of idle time the event loop spends in the event provider.
                          -- This option is necessary to use `metrics_idle_time()`.

success:
    | 0
```

## loop_mode


```lua
function uv.loop_mode()
  -> uv.aliases.run_mode|nil
```


If the loop is running, returns a string indicating the mode in use. If the loop
is not running, `nil` is returned instead.


```lua
return #1:
   -> 'default' -- Runs the event loop until there are no more active and referenced handles or requests.
                -- Returns `true` if `uv.stop()` was called and there are still active handles or requests.
                -- Returns `false` in all other cases.
    | 'once' -- Poll for I/O once. Note that this function blocks if there are no
             -- pending callbacks. Returns `false` when done (no active handles or requests
             -- left), or `true` if more callbacks are expected (meaning you should run the
             -- event loop again sometime in the future).
    | 'nowait' -- Poll for I/O once but don't block if there are no pending callbacks.
               -- Returns `false` if done (no active handles or requests left),
               -- or `true` if more callbacks are expected (meaning you should run the event loop again sometime in the future).
```

## metrics_idle_time


```lua
function uv.metrics_idle_time()
  -> integer
```


Retrieve the amount of time the event loop has been idle in the kernel’s event
provider (e.g. `epoll_wait`). The call is thread safe.

The return value is the accumulated time spent idle in the kernel’s event
provider starting from when the `uv_loop_t` was configured to collect the idle time.

**Note:** The event loop will not begin accumulating the event provider’s idle
time until calling `loop_configure` with `"metrics_idle_time"`.

## new_async


```lua
function uv.new_async(callback: fun(...uv.aliases.threadargs)|nil)
  -> handle: uv_async_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Creates and initializes a new `uv_async_t`. Returns the Lua userdata wrapping
it. A `nil` callback is allowed.

**Note**: Unlike other handle initialization functions, this immediately starts

Returns the Lua userdata wrapping it.

## new_socket_poll


```lua
function uv.new_socket_poll(fd: integer)
  -> uv_poll_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Initialize the handle using a socket descriptor. On Unix this is identical to
`uv.new_poll()`. On windows it takes a SOCKET handle.
The socket is set to non-blocking mode.

@*param* `fd` —  the file descriptor

## new_tcp


```lua
function uv.new_tcp(flags: integer|uv.aliases.network_family|nil)
  -> uv_tcp_t|nil

  -> luv_thread_t?
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Creates and initializes a `luv_thread_t` (not `uv_thread_t`). Returns the Lua
userdata wrapping it and asynchronously executes `entry`, which can be
either a Lua function or a string containing Lua code or bytecode dumped from a function. Additional arguments `...`
are passed to the `entry` function and an optional `options` table may be
provided. Currently accepted `option` fields are `stack_size`.

## new_timer

  -> uv_timer_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Creates and initializes a new `uv_timer_t`. Returns the Lua userdata wrapping it.

Some examples:
```lua
-- Creating a simple setTimeout wrapper
local function setTimeout(timeout, callback)
  local timer = uv.new_timer()
  timer:start(timeout, 0, function ()
    timer:stop()
    timer:close()
    callback()
  end)
  return timer
end

-- Creating a simple setInterval wrapper
local function setInterval(interval, callback)
  local timer = uv.new_timer()
  timer:start(interval, interval, function ()
    callback()
  end)
  return timer
end

-- And clearInterval
local function clearInterval(timer)
  timer:stop()
  timer:close()
end
```

## new_tty


```lua
function uv.new_tty(fd: integer|uv.aliases.tty_fd, readable: boolean)
  -> uv_tty_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Initialize a new TTY stream with the given file descriptor.
See below for possible file descriptors.

On Unix this function will determine the path of the fd of the terminal using
ttyname_r(3), open it, and use it if the passed file descriptor refers to a TTY.

This lets libuv put the tty in non-blocking mode without affecting other
processes that share the tty.

This function is not thread safe on systems that don’t support ioctl TIOCGPTN or TIOCPTYGNAME, for instance OpenBSD and Solaris.

**Note:** If reopening the TTY fails, libuv falls back to blocking writes.


```lua
fd:
    | 0 -- stdin
    | 1 -- stdout
    | 2 -- stderr
```

## new_udp


```lua
function uv.new_udp(flags: integer|uv.aliases.network_family|{ family: uv.aliases.network_family, mmsgs: integer }|nil)
  -> uv_udp_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Creates and initializes a new `uv_udp_t`. Returns the Lua userdata wrapping
it. The actual socket is created lazily.

See below for accepted `family` values.

When specified, `mmsgs` determines the number of messages able to be received
at one time via `recvmmsg(2)` (the allocated buffer will be sized to be able
to fit the specified number of max size dgrams). Only has an effect on
platforms that support `recvmmsg(2)`.

**Note:** For backwards compatibility reasons, `flags` can also be a string or
integer. When it is a string, it will be treated like the `family` key above.
When it is an integer, it will be used directly as the `flags` parameter when
calling `uv_udp_init_ex`.

@*param* `flags` —  (mmsgs default: `1`)

```lua
flags:
    | "unix"
    | "inet"
    | "inet6"
    | "ipx"
    | "netlink"
    | "x25"

function uv.new_work(work_callback: string|fun(...<T:uv.aliases.threadargs>), after_work_callback: fun(...uv.aliases.threadargs))
  -> luv_work_ctx_t
```


Creates and initializes a new `luv_work_ctx_t` (not `uv_work_t`).
`work_callback` is a Lua function or a string containing Lua code or bytecode dumped from a function.
Returns the Lua userdata wrapping it.

@*param* `work_callback` —  passed to/from `uv.queue_work(work_ctx, ...)`

@*param* `after_work_callback` —  returned from `work_callback`

## now


```lua
function uv.now()
  -> integer
```


Returns the current timestamp in milliseconds. The timestamp is cached at the
start of the event loop tick, see `uv.update_time()` for details and rationale.
The timestamp increases monotonically from some arbitrary point in time. Don't
make assumptions about the starting point, you will only get disappointed.

**Note**: Use `uv.hrtime()` if you need sub-millisecond granularity.

## os_environ


```lua
function uv.os_environ()
  -> { [string]: string }
```


Returns all environmental variables as a dynamic table of names associated with
their corresponding values.

**Warning:** This function is not thread safe.

## os_get_passwd


```lua
function uv.os_get_passwd()
  -> uv.aliases.os_passwd
```


Returns password file information.

## os_getenv


```lua
function uv.os_getenv(name: string, size: integer)
  -> string|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Returns the environment variable specified by `name` as string. The internal
buffer size can be set by defining `size`. If omitted, `LUAL_BUFFERSIZE` is
used. If the environment variable exceeds the storage available in the internal
buffer, `ENOBUFS` is returned. If no matching environment variable exists,
`ENOENT` is returned.

**Warning:** This function is not thread safe.

@*param* `size` —  (default = `LUAL_BUFFERSIZE`)

## os_gethostname

  -> uv.aliases.pipe_rtn|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Create a pair of connected pipe handles. Data may be written to the `write` fd and read from the `read` fd.
The resulting handles can be passed to `pipe_open`, used with `spawn`, or for any other purpose.

Flags:
 - `nonblock`: Opens the specified socket handle for `OVERLAPPED` or `FIONBIO`/`O_NONBLOCK` I/O usage.
 This is recommended for handles that will be used by libuv, and not usually recommended otherwise.

Equivalent to `pipe(2)` with the `O_CLOEXEC` flag set.

```lua
-- Simple read/write with pipe_open
local fds = uv.pipe({nonblock=true}, {nonblock=true})

local read_pipe = uv.new_pipe()
read_pipe:open(fds.read)

local write_pipe = uv.new_pipe()
write_pipe:open(fds.write)

write_pipe:write("hello")
read_pipe:read_start(function(err, chunk)
  assert(not err, err)

```


Alters pipe permissions, allowing it to be accessed from processes run by different users.
Makes the pipe writable or readable by all users.
See below for accepted flags, where `r` is `READABLE` and `w` is `WRITABLE`.
This function is blocking.


```lua
flags:
    | "r"
    | "w"
    | "rw"
    | "wr"

success:
    | 0
```

## pipe_connect

function uv.pipe_connect(pipe: uv_pipe_t, name: string, callback: fun(err?: string)|nil)
  -> stream: uv_connect_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?

  3. err_msg: string?
```


Open an existing file descriptor or `uv_handle_t` as a pipe.

**Note**: The file descriptor is set to non-blocking mode.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## pipe_pending_count


```lua
function uv.pipe_pending_count(pipe: uv_pipe_t)
  -> integer
```


Returns the pending pipe count for the named pipe.

## pipe_pending_instances


```lua
function uv.pipe_pending_instances(pipe: uv_pipe_t, count: integer)
```


Set the number of pending pipe instance handles when the pipe server is waiting
for connections.

**Note**: This setting applies to Windows only.

## pipe_pending_type


```lua
function uv.pipe_pending_type(pipe: uv_pipe_t)
  -> string
```


Used to receive handles over IPC pipes.

First - call `uv.pipe_pending_count()`, if it's > 0 then initialize a handle of
the given type, returned by `uv.pipe_pending_type()` and call
`uv.accept(pipe, handle)`.

## poll_start


```lua
function uv.poll_start(poll: uv_poll_t, events: uv.aliases.poll_events|nil, callback: fun(err?: string, events?: uv.aliases.poll_events))
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Starts polling the file descriptor.
See alias below for accepted `events`, where `r` is `READABLE`, `w` is `WRITABLE`, `d` is
`DISCONNECT`, and `p` is `PRIORITIZED`.
As soon as an event is detected
the callback will be called with status set to 0, and the detected events set on
the events field.

The user should not close the socket while the handle is active. If the user
does that anyway, the callback may be called reporting an error status, but this
is not guaranteed.

**Note** Calling `uv.poll_start()` on a handle that is already active is fine.
Doing so will update the events mask that is being watched for.

@*param* `events` —  (default: `"rw"`)

```lua
events:
    | "r"
    | "w"
   -> "rw"
    | "d"

```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## print_active_handles


```lua
function uv.print_active_handles()
```


The same as `uv.print_all_handles()` except only active handles are printed.

**Note:** This is not available on Windows.

**Warning:** This function is meant for ad hoc debugging, there are no API/ABI
stability guarantees.

## print_all_handles


```lua
function uv.print_all_handles()
```


Prints all handles associated with the main loop to stderr. The format is
`[flags] handle-type handle-address`. Flags are `R` for referenced, `A` for
active and `I` for internal.

**Note:** This is not available on Windows.

**Warning:** This function is meant for ad hoc debugging, there are no API/ABI
stability guarantees.

  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Queues a work request which will run `work_callback` in a new Lua state in a
thread from the threadpool with any additional arguments from `...`. Values
returned from `work_callback` are passed to `after_work_callback`, which is
called in the main loop thread.

## random


```lua
function uv.random(len: integer, flags: table|0|nil, callback: fun(err?: string, bytes?: string))
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Fills a string of length `len` with cryptographically strong random bytes
acquired from the system CSPRNG. `flags` is reserved for future extension
and must currently be `nil` or `0` or `{}`.

Short reads are not possible. When less than `len` random bytes are available,
a non-zero error value is returned or passed to the callback. If the callback
is omitted, this function is completed synchronously.
The synchronous version may block indefinitely when not enough entropy is
available. The asynchronous version may not ever finish when the system is
low on entropy.


```lua
flags:
    | 0

success:
    | 0
```

function uv.read_start(stream: uv_stream_t, callback: fun(err?: string, data?: string))
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Read data from an incoming stream. The callback will be made several times until
there is no more data to read or `uv.read_stop()` is called. When we've reached
EOF, `data` will be `nil`.

```lua
stream:read_start(function (err, chunk)
  if err then
    -- handle read error
  elseif chunk then
    -- handle data
  else
    -- handle disconnect
  end
end)
```


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## read_stop


```lua
function uv.read_stop(stream: uv_stream_t)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Stop reading data from the stream. The read callback will no longer be called.
This function is idempotent and may be safely called on a stopped stream.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## recv_buffer_size


```lua
function uv.recv_buffer_size(handle: uv_handle_t)
  -> integer|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Gets or sets the size of the receive buffer that the operating system uses for the socket.

If `size` is omitted (or `0`), this will return the current send buffer size; otherwise, this will use `size` to set the new send buffer size.

This function works for TCP, pipe and UDP handles on Unix and for TCP and UDP
handles on Windows.

**Note**: Linux will set double the size and return double the size of the
original set value.

@*param* `handle` — `userdata` for sub-type of `uv_handle_t`

## ref


```lua
function uv.ref(handle: uv_handle_t)
```


Reference the given handle. References are idempotent, that is, if a handle is
already referenced calling this function again will have no effect.

@*param* `handle` —  `userdata` for sub-type of `uv_handle_t`

## req_get_type


```lua
function uv.req_get_type(req: uv_req_t)
  -> uv.aliases.req_struct_name
  2. uv.aliases.req_struct_type
```


Returns the name of the struct for a given request (e.g. `"fs"` for `uv_fs_t`)
and the libuv enum integer for the request's type (`uv_req_type`).


```lua
return #1:
    | 'unknown' -- 0
    | 'req' -- 1
    | 'connect' -- 2
    | 'write' -- 3
    | 'shutdown' -- 4
    | 'udp_send' -- 5
    | 'fs' -- 6
    | 'work' -- 7
    | 'getaddrinfo' -- 8
    | 'getnameinfo' -- 9

  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Returns the resident set size (RSS) for the current process.

## run


```lua
function uv.run(mode: uv.aliases.run_mode|nil)
  -> boolean|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


This function runs the event loop. It will act differently depending on the
specified mode:
- `"default"`: Runs the event loop until there are no more active and
referenced handles or requests. Returns `true` if `uv.stop()` was called and
there are still active handles or requests. Returns `false` in all other
cases.
- `"once"`: Poll for I/O once. Note that this function blocks if there are no
pending callbacks. Returns `false` when done (no active handles or requests
left), or `true` if more callbacks are expected (meaning you should run the
event loop again sometime in the future).
- `"nowait"`: Poll for I/O once but don't block if there are no pending
callbacks. Returns `false` if done (no active handles or requests left),
or `true` if more callbacks are expected (meaning you should run the event
loop again sometime in the future).

**Note**: Luvit will implicitly call `uv.run()` after loading user code, but if
you use the luv bindings directly, you need to call this after registering
your initial set of event callbacks to start the event loop.


```lua
mode:
   -> 'default' -- Runs the event loop until there are no more active and referenced handles or requests.
                -- Returns `true` if `uv.stop()` was called and there are still active handles or requests.
                -- Returns `false` in all other cases.
    | 'once' -- Poll for I/O once. Note that this function blocks if there are no
             -- pending callbacks. Returns `false` when done (no active handles or requests
             -- left), or `true` if more callbacks are expected (meaning you should run the
             -- event loop again sometime in the future).
    | 'nowait' -- Poll for I/O once but don't block if there are no pending callbacks.
               -- Returns `false` if done (no active handles or requests left),
               -- or `true` if more callbacks are expected (meaning you should run the event loop again sometime in the future).
```

## send_buffer_size


```lua
function uv.send_buffer_size(handle: uv_handle_t)
  -> integer|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Gets or sets the size of the send buffer that the operating system uses for the socket.

If `size` is omitted (or `0`), this will return the current send buffer size; otherwise, this will use `size` to set the new send buffer size.

This function works for TCP, pipe and UDP handles on Unix and for TCP and UDP
handles on Windows.

**Note**: Linux will set double the size and return double the size of the
original set value.

@*param* `handle` —  `userdata` for sub-type of `uv_handle_t`

## set_process_title

  -> { [1]: integer, [2]: integer }|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Create a pair of connected sockets with the specified properties. The resulting handles can be passed to `uv.tcp_open`, used with `uv.spawn`, or for any other purpose.
When specified as a string, `socktype` must be one of `"stream"`, `"dgram"`, `"raw"`,
`"rdm"`, or `"seqpacket"`.

When `protocol` is set to 0 or nil, it will be automatically chosen based on the socket's domain and type. When `protocol` is specified as a string, it will be looked up using the `getprotobyname(3)` function (examples: `"ip"`, `"icmp"`, `"tcp"`, `"udp"`, etc).

Flags:
- `nonblock`: Opens the specified socket handle for `OVERLAPPED` or `FIONBIO`/`O_NONBLOCK` I/O usage. This is recommended for handles that will be used by libuv, and not usually recommended otherwise.

Equivalent to `socketpair(2)` with a domain of `AF_UNIX`.

```lua
-- Simple read/write with tcp
local fds = uv.socketpair(nil, nil, {nonblock=true}, {nonblock=true})

local sock1 = uv.new_tcp()
sock1:open(fds[1])

local sock2 = uv.new_tcp()

## spawn


```lua
function uv.spawn(path: string, options: uv.aliases.spawn_options, on_exit?: fun(code: integer, signal: integer))
  -> uv_process_t|nil
  2. string|integer
  3. string?
```


Initializes the process handle and starts the process. If the process is
successfully spawned, this function will return the handle and pid of the child
process.
Possible reasons for failing to spawn would include (but not be limited to) the
file to execute not existing, not having permissions to use the setuid or setgid
specified, or not having enough memory to allocate for the new process.

```lua
local stdin = uv.new_pipe()
local stdout = uv.new_pipe()
local stderr = uv.new_pipe()

print("stdin", stdin)
print("stdout", stdout)
print("stderr", stderr)

local handle, pid = uv.spawn("cat", {
   stdio = {stdin, stdout, stderr}
}, function(code, signal) -- on exit
   print("exit code", code)
   print("exit signal", signal)
end)

print("process opened", handle, pid)

uv.read_start(stdout, function(err, data)
   assert(not err, err)
   if data then
     print("stdout chunk", stdout, data)
   else
     print("stdout end", stdout)
   end
end)

uv.read_start(stderr, function(err, data)
   assert(not err, err)
   if data then
     print("stderr chunk", stderr, data)
   else
     print("stderr end", stderr)
   end
end)

uv.write(stdin, "Hello World")

uv.shutdown(stdin, function()
   print("stdin shutdown", stdin)
   uv.close(handle, function()
     print("process closed", handle, pid)
   end)
end)
```

The `options` table accepts the following fields:

 - `options.args` - Command line arguments as a list of string. The first
string should be the path to the program. On Windows, this uses CreateProcess
which concatenates the arguments into a string. This can cause some strange
errors. (See `options.verbatim` below for Windows.)

 - `options.stdio` - Set the file descriptors that will be made available to
  the child process. The convention is that the first entries are stdin, stdout,
  and stderr. (**Note**: On Windows, file descriptors after the third are
  available to the child process only if the child processes uses the MSVCRT
  runtime.)

 - `options.env` - Set environment variables for the new process.

 - `options.cwd` - Set the current working directory for the sub-process.

 - `options.uid` - Set the child process' user id.

 - `options.gid` - Set the child process' group id.

 - `options.verbatim` - If true, do not wrap any arguments in quotes, or
  perform any other escaping, when converting the argument list into a command
  line string. This option is only meaningful on Windows systems. On Unix it is
  silently ignored.

 - `options.detached` - If true, spawn the child process in a detached state -
  this will make it a process group leader, and will effectively enable the
  child to keep running after the parent exits. Note that the child process
  will still keep the parent's event loop alive unless the parent process calls
  `uv.unref()` on the child's process handle.

 - `options.hide` - If true, hide the subprocess console window that would
  normally be created. This option is only meaningful on Windows systems. On
  Unix it is silently ignored.
The `options.stdio` entries can take many shapes.

  - If they are numbers, then the child process inherits that same zero-indexed
  fd from the parent process.

 - If `uv_stream_t` handles are passed in, those are used as a read-write pipe
  or inherited stream depending if the stream has a valid fd.

 - Including `nil` placeholders means to ignore that fd in the child process.

When the child process exits, `on_exit` is called with an exit code and signal.

## stop


```lua
function uv.stop()
```


Stop the event loop, causing `uv.run()` to end as soon as possible. This
will happen not sooner than the next loop iteration. If this function was called
before blocking for I/O, the loop won't block for I/O on this iteration.

## stream_get_write_queue_size


```lua
function uv.stream_get_write_queue_size()
  -> integer
```


Returns the stream's write queue size.

## stream_set_blocking


```lua
function uv.stream_set_blocking(stream: uv_stream_t, blocking: boolean)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Enable or disable blocking mode for a stream.
When blocking mode is enabled all writes complete synchronously. The interface
remains unchanged otherwise, e.g. completion or failure of the operation will
still be reported through a callback which is made asynchronously.

**Warning**: Relying too much on this API is not recommended. It is likely to
change significantly in the future. Currently this only works on Windows and
only for `uv_pipe_t` handles. Also libuv currently makes no ordering guarantee
when the blocking mode is changed after write requests have already been
submitted. Therefore it is recommended to set the blocking mode immediately
after opening or creating the stream.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## tcp_bind


```lua
function uv.tcp_bind(tcp: uv_tcp_t, host: string, port: integer, flags: uv.aliases.tcp_bind_flags|nil)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Bind the handle to an host and port. `host` should be an IP address and
not a domain name. Any `flags` are set with a table with field `ipv6only`
equal to `true` or `false`.

When the port is already taken, you can expect to see an `EADDRINUSE` error
from either `uv.tcp_bind()`, `uv.listen()` or `uv.tcp_connect()`. That is, a
successful call to this function does not guarantee that the call to `uv.listen()`
or `uv.tcp_connect()` will succeed as well.

Use a port of `0` to let the OS assign an ephemeral port.  You can look it up
later using `uv.tcp_getsockname()`.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## tcp_close_reset


```lua
function uv.tcp_close_reset(tcp: uv_tcp_t, callback: fun()|nil)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Resets a TCP connection by sending a RST packet. This is accomplished by setting
the SO_LINGER socket option with a linger interval of zero and then calling
`uv.close()`. Due to some platform inconsistencies, mixing of `uv.shutdown()`
and `uv.tcp_close_reset()` calls is not allowed.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## tcp_connect


```lua
function uv.tcp_connect(tcp: uv_tcp_t, host: string, port: integer, callback: fun(err?: string))
  -> stream: uv_connect_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Establish an IPv4 or IPv6 TCP connection.

```lua
local client = uv.new_tcp()
client:connect("127.0.0.1", 8080, function (err)
  -- check error and carry on.
end)
```

## tcp_getpeername


```lua
function uv.tcp_getpeername(tcp: uv_tcp_t)
  -> uv.aliases.getname_sockname_rtn|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Get the address of the peer connected to the handle.

## tcp_getsockname


```lua
function uv.tcp_getsockname(tcp: uv_tcp_t)
  -> uv.aliases.getname_sockname_rtn|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Get the current address to which the handle is bound.

## tcp_keepalive


```lua
function uv.tcp_keepalive(tcp: uv_tcp_t, enable: boolean, delay: integer|nil)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Enable / disable TCP keep-alive. `delay` is the initial delay in seconds,
ignored when enable is `false`.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## tcp_nodelay


```lua
function uv.tcp_nodelay(tcp: uv_tcp_t, enable: boolean)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Enable / disable Nagle's algorithm.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## tcp_open


```lua
function uv.tcp_open(tcp: uv_tcp_t, sock: integer)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Open an existing file descriptor or SOCKET as a TCP handle.

**Note:** The passed file descriptor or SOCKET is not checked for its type, but it's required that it represents a valid stream socket.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## tcp_simultaneous_accepts


```lua
function uv.tcp_simultaneous_accepts(tcp: uv_tcp_t, enable: boolean)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Enable / disable simultaneous asynchronous accept requests that are queued by
the operating system when listening for new TCP connections.

This setting is used to tune a TCP server for the desired performance. Having
simultaneous accepts can significantly improve the rate of accepting connections
(which is why it is enabled by default) but may lead to uneven load distribution
in multi-process setups.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## tcp_write_queue_size


```lua
function uv.tcp_write_queue_size(tcp: uv_tcp_t)
```


Please use `uv.stream_get_write_queue_size()` instead.

## thread_equal


```lua
function uv.thread_equal(thread: luv_thread_t, other_thread: luv_thread_t)
  -> boolean
```


Returns a boolean indicating whether two threads are the same. This function is
equivalent to the `__eq` metamethod.

## thread_join


```lua
function uv.thread_join(thread: luv_thread_t)
  -> boolean?
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Waits for the `thread` to finish executing its entry function.

## thread_self


```lua
function uv.thread_self()
  -> luv_thread_t
```


Returns the handle for the thread in which this is called.

## timer_again


```lua
function uv.timer_again(timer: uv_timer_t)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Stop the timer, and if it is repeating restart it using the repeat value as the
timeout. If the timer has never been started before it raises `EINVAL`.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## timer_get_due_in


```lua
function uv.timer_get_due_in(timer: uv_timer_t)
  -> integer
```


Get the timer due value or 0 if it has expired. The time is relative to `uv.now()`.

**Note**: New in libuv version 1.40.0.

## timer_get_repeat


```lua
function uv.timer_get_repeat(timer: uv_timer_t)
  -> integer
```


Get the timer repeat value.

## timer_set_repeat


```lua
function uv.timer_set_repeat(timer: uv_timer_t, repeat_n: integer)
```


Set the repeat interval value in milliseconds. The timer will be scheduled to
run on the given interval, regardless of the callback execution duration, and
will follow normal timer semantics in the case of a time-slice overrun.

For example, if a 50 ms repeating timer first runs for 17 ms, it will be
scheduled to run again 33 ms later. If other tasks consume more than the 33 ms
following the first timer callback, then the callback will run as soon as
possible.

## timer_start


```lua
function uv.timer_start(timer: uv_timer_t, timeout: integer, repeat_n: integer, callback: fun())
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Start the timer. `timeout` and `repeat_n` are in milliseconds.

If `timeout` is zero, the callback fires on the next event loop iteration. If
`repeat_n` is non-zero, the callback fires first after `timeout` milliseconds and
then repeatedly after `repeat_n` milliseconds.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## timer_stop


```lua
function uv.timer_stop(timer: uv_timer_t)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Stop the timer, the callback will not be called anymore.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## translate_sys_error


```lua
function uv.translate_sys_error(errcode: integer)
  -> string|nil
  2. string|nil
```


Returns the libuv error message and error name (both in string form, see `err` and `name` in Error Handling) equivalent to the given platform dependent error code: POSIX error codes on Unix (the ones stored in errno), and Win32 error codes on Windows (those returned by GetLastError() or WSAGetLastError()).

## try_write


```lua
function uv.try_write(stream: uv_stream_t, data: uv.aliases.buffer)
  -> integer|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Same as `uv.write()`, but won't queue a write request if it can't be completed
immediately.
Will return number of bytes written (can be less than the supplied buffer size).

## try_write2


```lua
function uv.try_write2(stream: uv_stream_t, data: uv.aliases.buffer, send_handle: uv_pipe_t|uv_tcp_t)
  -> integer|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Like `uv.write2()`, but with the properties of `uv.try_write()`. Not supported on Windows, where it returns `UV_EAGAIN`.
Will return number of bytes written (can be less than the supplied buffer size).

## tty_get_vterm_state


```lua
function uv.tty_get_vterm_state()
  -> uv.aliases.tty_vsterm_state|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Get the current state of whether console virtual terminal sequences are handled
by libuv or the console. The return value is `"supported"` or `"unsupported"`.
This function is not implemented on Unix, where it returns `ENOTSUP`.


```lua
return #1:
    | "supported"
    | "unsupported"
```

## tty_get_winsize


```lua
function uv.tty_get_winsize(tty: uv_tty_t)
  -> integer
  2. integer|nil
  3. err_name: string?
  4. err_msg: string?
```


Gets the current Window width and height.

## tty_reset_mode


```lua
function uv.tty_reset_mode()
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


To be called when the program exits. Resets TTY settings to default values for
the next process to take over.
This function is async signal-safe on Unix platforms but can fail with error
code `EBUSY` if you call it when execution is inside `uv.tty_set_mode()`.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## tty_set_mode


```lua
function uv.tty_set_mode(tty: uv_tty_t, mode: uv.aliases.tty_mode)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Set the TTY using the specified terminal mode.

Parameter `mode` is a C enum with the values below.


```lua
mode:
    | 0 -- UV_TTY_MODE_NORMAL: Initial/normal terminal mode
    | 1 -- UV_TTY_MODE_RAW: Raw input mode (On Windows, ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT is also enabled)
    | 2 -- UV_TTY_MODE_IO: Binary-safe I/O mode for IPC (Unix-only)

success:
    | 0
```

## tty_set_vterm_state


```lua
function uv.tty_set_vterm_state(state: uv.aliases.tty_vsterm_state)
```


Controls whether console virtual terminal sequences are processed by libuv or
console. Useful in particular for enabling ConEmu support of ANSI X3.64 and
Xterm 256 colors. Otherwise Windows10 consoles are usually detected
automatically. State should be one of: `"supported"` or `"unsupported"`.

This function is only meaningful on Windows systems. On Unix it is silently
ignored.


```lua
state:
    | "supported"
    | "unsupported"
```

## udp_bind


```lua
function uv.udp_bind(udp: uv_udp_t, host: string, port: integer, flags: { ipv6only: boolean, reuseaddr: boolean }|nil)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Bind the UDP handle to an IP address and port. Any `flags` are set with a table
with fields `reuseaddr` or `ipv6only` equal to `true` or `false`.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## udp_connect


```lua
function uv.udp_connect(udp: uv_udp_t, host: string, port: integer)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Associate the UDP handle to a remote address and port, so every message sent by
this handle is automatically sent to that destination. Calling this function
with a NULL addr disconnects the handle. Trying to call `uv.udp_connect()` on an
already connected handle will result in an `EISCONN` error. Trying to disconnect
a handle that is not connected will return an `ENOTCONN` error.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## udp_get_send_queue_count


```lua
function uv.udp_get_send_queue_count()
  -> integer
```


Returns the handle's send queue count.

## udp_get_send_queue_size


```lua
function uv.udp_get_send_queue_size()
  -> integer
```


Returns the handle's send queue size.

## udp_getpeername


```lua
function uv.udp_getpeername(udp: uv_udp_t)
  -> { ip: string, family: uv.aliases.network_family, port: integer }|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Get the remote IP and port of the UDP handle on connected UDP handles.

## udp_getsockname


```lua
function uv.udp_getsockname(udp: uv_udp_t)
  -> { ip: string, family: uv.aliases.network_family, port: integer }|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Get the local IP and port of the UDP handle.

## udp_open


```lua
function uv.udp_open(udp: uv_udp_t, fd: integer)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Opens an existing file descriptor or Windows SOCKET as a UDP handle.

Unix only: The only requirement of the sock argument is that it follows the
datagram contract (works in unconnected mode, supports sendmsg()/recvmsg(),
etc). In other words, other datagram-type sockets like raw sockets or netlink
sockets can also be passed to this function.

The file descriptor is set to non-blocking mode.

**Note:** The passed file descriptor or SOCKET is not checked for its type, but
it's required that it represents a valid datagram socket.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## udp_recv_start


```lua
function uv.udp_recv_start(udp: uv_udp_t, callback: fun(err?: string, data?: string, add?: { ip: string, port: integer, family: uv.aliases.network_family }, flags: { partial: boolean|nil, mmsg_chunk: boolean|nil }))
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Prepare for receiving data. If the socket has not previously been bound with
`uv.udp_bind()` it is bound to `0.0.0.0` (the "all interfaces" IPv4 address)
and a random port number.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## udp_recv_stop


```lua
function uv.udp_recv_stop(udp: uv_udp_t)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Stop listening for incoming datagrams.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## udp_send


```lua
function uv.udp_send(udp: uv_udp_t, data: uv.aliases.buffer, host: string, port: integer, callback: fun(err?: string))
  -> stream: uv_udp_send_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Send data over the UDP socket. If the socket has not previously been bound
with `uv.udp_bind()` it will be bound to `0.0.0.0` (the "all interfaces" IPv4
address) and a random port number.

## udp_set_broadcast


```lua
function uv.udp_set_broadcast(udp: uv_udp_t, on: boolean)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Set broadcast on or off.


```lua

```lua
function uv.udp_set_membership(udp: uv_udp_t, multicast_addr: string, interface_addr: string|nil, membership: "join"|"leave")
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Set membership for a multicast address. `multicast_addr` is multicast address to
set membership for. `interface_addr` is interface address. `membership` can be
the string `"leave"` or `"join"`.


```lua
membership:
    | "leave"
    | "join"

success:
    | 0
```

## udp_set_multicast_interface


```lua
function uv.udp_set_multicast_interface(udp: uv_udp_t, interface_addr: string)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Set the multicast interface to send or receive data on.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## udp_set_multicast_loop


```lua
function uv.udp_set_multicast_loop(udp: uv_udp_t, on: boolean)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Set IP multicast loop flag. Makes multicast packets loop back to local
sockets.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## udp_set_multicast_ttl


```lua
function uv.udp_set_multicast_ttl(udp: uv_udp_t, ttl: integer)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Set the multicast ttl.
`ttl` is an integer 1 through 255.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## udp_set_source_membership


```lua
function uv.udp_set_source_membership(udp: uv_udp_t, multicast_addr: string, interface_addr: string|nil, source_addr: string, membership: "join"|"leave")
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Set membership for a source-specific multicast group. `multicast_addr` is multicast
address to set membership for. `interface_addr` is interface address. `source_addr`
is source address. `membership` can be the string `"leave"` or `"join"`.


```lua
membership:
    | "leave"
    | "join"

success:
    | 0
```

## udp_set_ttl


```lua
function uv.udp_set_ttl(udp: uv_udp_t, ttl: integer)
  -> success: 0|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Set the time to live.
`ttl` is an integer 1 through 255.


```lua
success:
    | 0
```

## udp_try_send


```lua
function uv.udp_try_send(udp: uv_udp_t, data: uv.aliases.buffer, host: string, port: integer)
  -> integer|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Same as `uv.udp_send()`, but won't queue a send request if it can't be
completed immediately.

## unref


```lua
function uv.unref(handle: uv_handle_t)
```


Un-reference the given handle. References are idempotent, that is, if a handle
is not referenced calling this function again will have no effect.

@*param* `handle` —  `userdata` for sub-type of `uv_handle_t`

## update_time


```lua
function uv.update_time()
```


Update the event loop's concept of "now". Libuv caches the current time at the
start of the event loop tick in order to reduce the number of time-related
system calls.
You won't normally need to call this function unless you have callbacks that
block the event loop for longer periods of time, where "longer" is somewhat
subjective but probably on the order of a millisecond or more.

## uptime


```lua
function uv.uptime()
  -> number|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Returns the current system uptime in seconds.

## version


```lua
function uv.version()
  -> integer
```


Returns the libuv version packed into a single integer. 8 bits are used for each
component, with the patch number stored in the 8 least significant bits. For
example, this would be 0x010203 in libuv 1.2.3.

## version_string


```lua
function uv.version_string()
  -> string
```


Returns the libuv version number as a string. For example, this would be "1.2.3"
in libuv 1.2.3. For non-release versions, the version suffix is included.

## walk


```lua
function uv.walk(callback: fun(handle: uv.aliases.handle_instances))
```


Walk the list of handles: `callback` will be executed with each handle.

Example usage of uv.walk to close all handles that aren't already closing.
```lua
uv.walk(function (handle)
  if not handle:is_closing() then
    handle:close()
  end
end)
```

## write


```lua
function uv.write(stream: uv_stream_t, data: uv.aliases.buffer, callback: fun(err?: string)|nil)
  -> stream: uv_write_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Write data to stream.
`data` can either be a Lua string or a table of strings. If a table is passed
in, the C backend will use writev to send all strings in a single system call.
The optional `callback` is for knowing when the write is complete.

## write2


```lua
function uv.write2(stream: uv_stream_t, data: uv.aliases.buffer, send_handle: uv_pipe_t|uv_tcp_t, callback: fun()|nil)
  -> stream: uv_write_t|nil
  2. err_name: string?
  3. err_msg: string?
```


Extended write function for sending handles over a pipe. The pipe must be
initialized with `ipc` option `true`.

**Note:** `send_handle` must be a TCP socket or pipe, which is a server or a
connection (listening or connected state). Bound sockets or pipes will be
assumed to be servers.

# uv.errno


In libuv, errors are negative numbered constants; however, while those errors are exposed through `uv.errno`,
the functions used to handle them are not exposed to luv users. Instead, if an
internal error is encountered, the luv function will return to the caller an
assertable `nil, err, name` tuple.

- `nil` idiomatically indicates failure
- `err` is a string with the format `{name}: {message}`
  - `{name}` is the error name provided internally by `uv_err_name`
  - `{message}` is a human-readable message provided internally by `uv_strerror`
- `name` is the same string used to construct `err`

This tuple is referred to below as the `fail` pseudo-type.

When a function is called successfully, it will return either a value that is
relevant to the operation of the function, or the integer `0` to indicate
success, or sometimes nothing at all. These cases are documented below.



```lua
{ E2BIG: integer, EACCES: integer, EADDRINUSE: integer, EADDRNOTAVAIL: integer, EAFNOSUPPORT: integer, EAGAIN: integer, EAI_ADDRFAMILY: integer, EAI_AGAIN: integer, EAI_BADFLAGS: i...(too long)... integer }

# uv_idle_t


Idle handles will run the given callback once per loop iteration, right before
the `uv_prepare_t` handles.

**Note**: The notable difference with prepare handles is that when there are
active idle handles, the loop will perform a zero timeout poll instead of
blocking for I/O.

**Warning**: Despite the name, idle handles will get their callbacks called on
every loop iteration, not when the loop is actually "idle".

```lua
local idle = uv.new_idle()
idle:start(function()
  print("Before I/O polling, no blocking")
end)

# uv_loop_t


The event loop is the central part of libuv's functionality. It takes care of
 polling for I/O and scheduling callbacks to be run based on different sources of events.

In luv, there is an implicit uv loop for every Lua state that loads the library.
You can use this library in an multi-threaded environment as long as each thread
has it's own Lua state with its corresponding own uv loop. This loop is not
directly exposed to users in the Lua module.

# uv_poll_t


Poll handles are used to watch file descriptors for readability and writability,
similar to the purpose of [poll(2)](http://linux.die.net/man/2/poll).

The purpose of poll handles is to enable integrating external libraries that
rely on the event loop to signal it about the socket status changes, like c-ares
or libssh2. Using `uv_poll_t` for any other purpose is not recommended;
`uv_tcp_t`, `uv_udp_t`, etc. provide an implementation that is faster and more
scalable than what can be achieved with `uv_poll_t`, especially on Windows.

It is possible that poll handles occasionally signal that a file descriptor is
readable or writable even when it isn't. The user should therefore always be
prepared to handle EAGAIN or equivalent when it attempts to read from or write
to the fd.

It is not okay to have multiple active poll handles for the same socket, this
can cause libuv to busyloop or otherwise malfunction.

The user should not close a file descriptor while it is being polled by an
active poll handle. This can cause the handle to report an error, but it might
also start polling another socket. However the fd can be safely closed
immediately after a call to `uv.poll_stop()` or `uv.close()`.

**Note**: On windows only sockets can be polled with poll handles. On Unix any
file descriptor that would be accepted by poll(2) can be used.

# uv_signal_t


Signal handles implement Unix style signal handling on a per-event loop bases.

**Windows Notes:**

Reception of some signals is emulated on Windows:
  - SIGINT is normally delivered when the user presses CTRL+C. However, like on
  Unix, it is not generated when terminal raw mode is enabled.
  - SIGBREAK is delivered when the user pressed CTRL + BREAK.
  - SIGHUP is generated when the user closes the console window. On SIGHUP the
  program is given approximately 10 seconds to perform cleanup. After that
  Windows will unconditionally terminate it.
  - SIGWINCH is raised whenever libuv detects that the console has been resized.
  SIGWINCH is emulated by libuv when the program uses a uv_tty_t handle to write
  to the console. SIGWINCH may not always be delivered in a timely manner; libuv
  will only detect size changes when the cursor is being moved. When a readable
  [`uv_tty_t`][] handle is used in raw mode, resizing the console buffer will
  also trigger a SIGWINCH signal.
  - Watchers for other signals can be successfully created, but these signals
  are never received. These signals are: SIGILL, SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV,
  SIGTERM and SIGKILL.
  - Calls to raise() or abort() to programmatically raise a signal are not
  detected by libuv; these will not trigger a signal watcher.

**Unix Notes:**

  - SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are impossible to catch.
  - Handling SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL or SIGSEGV via libuv results into undefined
  behavior.
  - SIGABRT will not be caught by libuv if generated by abort(), e.g. through
  assert().
  - On Linux SIGRT0 and SIGRT1 (signals 32 and 33) are used by the NPTL pthreads
  library to manage threads. Installing watchers for those signals will lead to
  unpredictable behavior and is strongly discouraged. Future versions of libuv
  may simply reject them.

```lua
-- Create a new signal handler
local signal = uv.new_signal()
-- Define a handler function
uv.signal_start(signal, "sigint", function(signal)
  print("got " .. signal .. ", shutting down")
  os.exit(1)
end)

## nvim_buf_add_highlight


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_add_highlight(buffer: buffer, ns_id: number, hl_group: string, line: number, col_start: number, col_end: number)
  -> number
```

 Adds a highlight to buffer.
 
 Useful for plugins that dynamically generate highlights to a buffer (like
 a semantic highlighter or linter). The function adds a single highlight to
 a buffer. Unlike |matchaddpos()| highlights follow changes to line
 numbering (as lines are inserted/removed above the highlighted line), like
 signs and marks do.
 
 Namespaces are used for batch deletion/updating of a set of highlights. To
 create a namespace, use |nvim_create_namespace()| which returns a
 namespace id. Pass it in to this function as `ns_id` to add highlights to
 the namespace. All highlights in the same namespace can then be cleared
 with single call to |nvim_buf_clear_namespace()|. If the highlight never
 will be deleted by an API call, pass `ns_id = -1`.
 
 As a shorthand, `ns_id = 0` can be used to create a new namespace for the
 highlight, the allocated id is then returned. If `hl_group` is the empty
 string no highlight is added, but a new `ns_id` is still returned. This is
 supported for backwards compatibility, new code should use
 |nvim_create_namespace()| to create a new empty namespace.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}     Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {ns_id}      namespace to use or -1 for ungrouped highlight
   • {hl_group}   Name of the highlight group to use
   • {line}       Line to highlight (zero-indexed)
   • {col_start}  Start of (byte-indexed) column range to highlight
   • {col_end}    End of (byte-indexed) column range to highlight, or -1 to
                  highlight to end of line
 
 Return: ~
     The ns_id that was used

## nvim_buf_attach


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_attach(buffer: buffer, send_buffer: boolean, opts: table<string, any>)
  -> boolean
```

 Activates buffer-update events on a channel, or as Lua callbacks.
 
 Example (Lua): capture buffer updates in a global `events` variable (use "print(vim.inspect(events))" to see its contents): 
 ```lua
   events = {}
   vim.api.nvim_buf_attach(0, false, {
     on_lines=function(...) table.insert(events, {...}) end})
 ```
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}       Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {send_buffer}  True if the initial notification should contain the
                    whole buffer: first notification will be
                    `nvim_buf_lines_event`. Else the first notification
                    will be `nvim_buf_changedtick_event`. Not for Lua
                    callbacks.
   • {opts}         Optional parameters.
                    • on_lines: Lua callback invoked on change. Return `true` to detach. Args:
                      • the string "lines"
                      • buffer handle
                      • b:changedtick
                      • first line that changed (zero-indexed)
                      • last line that was changed
                      • last line in the updated range
                      • byte count of previous contents
                      • deleted_codepoints (if `utf_sizes` is true)
                      • deleted_codeunits (if `utf_sizes` is true)
 
                    • on_bytes: lua callback invoked on change. This
                      callback receives more granular information about the
                      change compared to on_lines. Return `true` to detach. Args:
                      • the string "bytes"
                      • buffer handle
                      • b:changedtick
                      • start row of the changed text (zero-indexed)
                      • start column of the changed text
                      • byte offset of the changed text (from the start of
                        the buffer)
                      • old end row of the changed text
                      • old end column of the changed text
                      • old end byte length of the changed text
                      • new end row of the changed text
                      • new end column of the changed text
                      • new end byte length of the changed text
 
                    • on_changedtick: Lua callback invoked on changedtick
                      increment without text change. Args:
                      • the string "changedtick"
                      • buffer handle
                      • b:changedtick

                    • on_reload: Lua callback invoked on reload. The entire
                      buffer content should be considered changed. Args:
                      • the string "reload"
                      • buffer handle
 
                    • utf_sizes: include UTF-32 and UTF-16 size of the
                      replaced region, as args to `on_lines`.
                    • preview: also attach to command preview (i.e.
                      'inccommand') events.
 
 Return: ~
     False if attach failed (invalid parameter, or buffer isn't loaded);
     otherwise True. TODO: LUA_API_NO_EVAL

## nvim_buf_call


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_call(buffer: buffer, fun: fun())
  -> any
```

 call a function with buffer as temporary current buffer
 
 This temporarily switches current buffer to "buffer". If the current
 window already shows "buffer", the window is not switched If a window
 inside the current tabpage (including a float) already shows the buffer
 One of these windows will be set as current window temporarily. Otherwise
 a temporary scratch window (called the "autocmd window" for historical
 reasons) will be used.
 
 This is useful e.g. to call vimL functions that only work with the current
 buffer/window currently, like |termopen()|.
 
 Attributes: ~
     Lua |vim.api| only
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {fun}     Function to call inside the buffer (currently lua callable
               only)
 
 Return: ~
     Return value of function. NB: will deepcopy lua values currently, use
     upvalues to send lua references in and out.

## nvim_buf_clear_namespace


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(buffer: buffer, ns_id: number, line_start: number, line_end: number)
```

 Clears |namespace|d objects (highlights, |extmarks|, virtual text) from a
 region.
 
 Lines are 0-indexed. |api-indexing| To clear the namespace in the entire
 buffer, specify line_start=0 and line_end=-1.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}      Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {ns_id}       Namespace to clear, or -1 to clear all namespaces.
   • {line_start}  Start of range of lines to clear
   • {line_end}    End of range of lines to clear (exclusive) or -1 to
                   clear to end of buffer.

## nvim_buf_create_user_command


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_create_user_command(buffer: buffer, name: string, command: any, opts?: table<string, any>)
```

 Creates a buffer-local command |user-commands|.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer.

## nvim_buf_get_extmarks


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(buffer: buffer, ns_id: number, start: any, end_: any, opts: table<string, any>)
  -> any[]
```

 Gets |extmarks| in "traversal order" from a |charwise| region defined by
 buffer positions (inclusive, 0-indexed |api-indexing|).
 
 Region can be given as (row,col) tuples, or valid extmark ids (whose
 positions define the bounds). 0 and -1 are understood as (0,0) and (-1,-1)
 respectively, thus the following are equivalent: 
 ```lua
   vim.api.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, my_ns, 0, -1, {})
   vim.api.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, my_ns, {0,0}, {-1,-1}, {})
 ```
 
 If `end` is less than `start`, traversal works backwards. (Useful with
 `limit`, to get the first marks prior to a given position.)
 
 Example: 
 ```lua
   local a   = vim.api
   local pos = a.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
   local ns  = a.nvim_create_namespace('my-plugin')
   -- Create new extmark at line 1, column 1.
   local m1  = a.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns, 0, 0, {})
   -- Create new extmark at line 3, column 1.
   local m2  = a.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns, 2, 0, {})
   -- Get extmarks only from line 3.
   local ms  = a.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, ns, {2,0}, {2,0}, {})
   -- Get all marks in this buffer + namespace.
   local all = a.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, ns, 0, -1, {})
   print(vim.inspect(ms))
 ```
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {ns_id}   Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
   • {start}   Start of range: a 0-indexed (row, col) or valid extmark id
               (whose position defines the bound). |api-indexing|
   • {end}     End of range (inclusive): a 0-indexed (row, col) or valid
               extmark id (whose position defines the bound).
               |api-indexing|
   • {opts}    Optional parameters. Keys:
               • limit: Maximum number of marks to return
               • details Whether to include the details dict
 
 Return: ~
     List of [extmark_id, row, col] tuples in "traversal order".

## nvim_buf_get_keymap


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_get_keymap(buffer: buffer, mode: string)
  -> any[]
```

 Gets a list of buffer-local |mapping| definitions.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {mode}    Mode short-name ("n", "i", "v", ...)
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
 
 Return: ~
     Array of |maparg()|-like dictionaries describing mappings. The
     "buffer" key holds the associated buffer handle.

## nvim_buf_get_lines


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(buffer: buffer, start: number, end_: number, strict_indexing: boolean)
  -> string[]
```

 Gets a line-range from the buffer.
 
 Indexing is zero-based, end-exclusive. Negative indices are interpreted as
 length+1+index: -1 refers to the index past the end. So to get the last
 element use start=-2 and end=-1.
 
 Out-of-bounds indices are clamped to the nearest valid value, unless
 `strict_indexing` is set.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}           Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {start}            First line index
   • {end}              Last line index, exclusive
   • {strict_indexing}  Whether out-of-bounds should be an error.
 
 Return: ~
     Array of lines, or empty array for unloaded buffer.

## nvim_buf_get_mark


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_get_mark(buffer: buffer, name: string)
  -> number[]
```

 Returns a tuple (row,col) representing the position of the named mark. See
 |mark-motions|.
 
 Marks are (1,0)-indexed. |api-indexing|
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {name}    Mark name
 
 Return: ~
     (row, col) tuple, (0, 0) if the mark is not set, or is an
     uppercase/file mark set in another buffer.
 
 See also: ~
   • |nvim_buf_set_mark()|
   • |nvim_buf_del_mark()|

## nvim_buf_get_name


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(buffer: buffer)
  -> string
```

 Gets the full file name for the buffer
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
 
 Return: ~
     Buffer name

## nvim_buf_get_offset


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_get_offset(buffer: buffer, index: number)
  -> number
```

 Returns the byte offset of a line (0-indexed). |api-indexing|
 
 Line 1 (index=0) has offset 0. UTF-8 bytes are counted. EOL is one byte.
 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' are ignored. The line index just after the
 last line gives the total byte-count of the buffer. A final EOL byte is
 counted if it would be written, see 'eol'.
 
 Unlike |line2byte()|, throws error for out-of-bounds indexing. Returns -1
 for unloaded buffer.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {index}   Line index
 
 Return: ~
     Integer byte offset, or -1 for unloaded buffer.

## nvim_buf_get_option


```lua

 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {name}    Option name
 
 Return: ~
     Option value

## nvim_buf_get_text


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_get_text(buffer: buffer, start_row: number, start_col: number, end_row: number, end_col: number, opts: table<string, any>)
  -> string[]
```

 Gets a range from the buffer.
 
 This differs from |nvim_buf_get_lines()| in that it allows retrieving only
 portions of a line.
 
 Indexing is zero-based. Row indices are end-inclusive, and column indices
 are end-exclusive.
 
 Prefer |nvim_buf_get_lines()| when retrieving entire lines.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}     Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {start_row}  First line index
   • {start_col}  Starting column (byte offset) on first line
   • {end_row}    Last line index, inclusive
   • {end_col}    Ending column (byte offset) on last line, exclusive
   • {opts}       Optional parameters. Currently unused.
 
 Return: ~
     Array of lines, or empty array for unloaded buffer.

## nvim_buf_get_var


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_get_var(buffer: buffer, name: string)
  -> any
```

 Gets a buffer-scoped (b:) variable.
 
 Parameters: ~

## nvim_buf_is_loaded


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_is_loaded(buffer: buffer)
  -> boolean
```

 Checks if a buffer is valid and loaded. See |api-buffer| for more info
 about unloaded buffers.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
 
 Return: ~
     true if the buffer is valid and loaded, false otherwise.

## nvim_buf_is_valid


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_is_valid(buffer: buffer)
  -> boolean
```

 Checks if a buffer is valid.
 
 Note:
     Even if a buffer is valid it may have been unloaded. See |api-buffer|
     for more info about unloaded buffers.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
 
 Return: ~
     true if the buffer is valid, false otherwise.

## nvim_buf_line_count


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_line_count(buffer: buffer)
  -> number
```

## nvim_buf_set_extmark


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(buffer: buffer, ns_id: number, line: number, col: number, opts?: table<string, any>)
  -> number
```

 Creates or updates an |extmark|.
 
 By default a new extmark is created when no id is passed in, but it is
 also possible to create a new mark by passing in a previously unused id or
 move an existing mark by passing in its id. The caller must then keep
 track of existing and unused ids itself. (Useful over RPC, to avoid
 waiting for the return value.)
 
 Using the optional arguments, it is possible to use this to highlight a
 range of text, and also to associate virtual text to the mark.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {ns_id}   Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
   • {line}    Line where to place the mark, 0-based. |api-indexing|
   • {col}     Column where to place the mark, 0-based. |api-indexing|
   • {opts}    Optional parameters.
               • id : id of the extmark to edit.
               • end_row : ending line of the mark, 0-based inclusive.
               • end_col : ending col of the mark, 0-based exclusive.
               • hl_group : name of the highlight group used to highlight
                 this mark.
               • hl_eol : when true, for a multiline highlight covering the
                 EOL of a line, continue the highlight for the rest of the
                 screen line (just like for diff and cursorline highlight).
               • virt_text : virtual text to link to this mark. A list of
                 [text, highlight] tuples, each representing a text chunk
                 with specified highlight. `highlight` element can either
                 be a single highlight group, or an array of multiple
                 highlight groups that will be stacked (highest priority
                 last). A highlight group can be supplied either as a
                 string or as an integer, the latter which can be obtained
                 using |nvim_get_hl_id_by_name()|.
               • virt_text_pos : position of virtual text. Possible values:
                 • "eol": right after eol character (default)
                 • "overlay": display over the specified column, without
                   shifting the underlying text.
                 • "right_align": display right aligned in the window.
 
               • virt_text_win_col : position the virtual text at a fixed
                 window column (starting from the first text column)
               • virt_text_hide : hide the virtual text when the background
                 text is selected or hidden due to horizontal scroll
                 'nowrap'
               • hl_mode : control how highlights are combined with the
                 highlights of the text. Currently only affects virt_text
                 highlights, but might affect `hl_group` in later versions.
                 • "replace": only show the virt_text color. This is the
                   default
                 • "combine": combine with background text color
                 • "blend": blend with background text color.
 
               • virt_lines : virtual lines to add next to this mark This
                 should be an array over lines, where each line in turn is
                 an array over [text, highlight] tuples. In general, buffer
                 and window options do not affect the display of the text.
                 In particular 'wrap' and 'linebreak' options do not take
                 effect, so the number of extra screen lines will always
                 match the size of the array. However the 'tabstop' buffer
                 option is still used for hard tabs. By default lines are
                 placed below the buffer line containing the mark.
               • virt_lines_above: place virtual lines above instead.
               • virt_lines_leftcol: Place extmarks in the leftmost column
                 of the window, bypassing sign and number columns.
               • ephemeral : for use with |nvim_set_decoration_provider()|
                 callbacks. The mark will only be used for the current
                 redraw cycle, and not be permantently stored in the
                 buffer.
               • right_gravity : boolean that indicates the direction the
                 extmark will be shifted in when new text is inserted (true
                 for right, false for left). Defaults to true.
               • end_right_gravity : boolean that indicates the direction
                 the extmark end position (if it exists) will be shifted in
                 when new text is inserted (true for right, false for
                 left). Defaults to false.
               • priority: a priority value for the highlight group or sign
                 attribute. For example treesitter highlighting uses a
                 value of 100.
               • strict: boolean that indicates extmark should not be
                 placed if the line or column value is past the end of the
                 buffer or end of the line respectively. Defaults to true.
               • sign_text: string of length 1-2 used to display in the
                 sign column. Note: ranges are unsupported and decorations
                 are only applied to start_row
               • sign_hl_group: name of the highlight group used to
                 highlight the sign column text. Note: ranges are
                 unsupported and decorations are only applied to start_row
               • number_hl_group: name of the highlight group used to
                 highlight the number column. Note: ranges are unsupported
                 and decorations are only applied to start_row
               • line_hl_group: name of the highlight group used to
                 highlight the whole line. Note: ranges are unsupported and
                 decorations are only applied to start_row
               • cursorline_hl_group: name of the highlight group used to
                 highlight the line when the cursor is on the same line as
                 the mark and 'cursorline' is enabled. Note: ranges are
                 unsupported and decorations are only applied to start_row
               • conceal: string which should be either empty or a single
                 character. Enable concealing similar to |:syn-conceal|.
                 When a character is supplied it is used as |:syn-cchar|.
                 "hl_group" is used as highlight for the cchar if provided,
                 otherwise it defaults to |hl-Conceal|.
               • spell: boolean indicating that spell checking should be
                 performed within this extmark
               • ui_watched: boolean that indicates the mark should be
                 drawn by a UI. When set, the UI will receive win_extmark
                 events. Note: the mark is positioned by virt_text
                 attributes. Can be used together with virt_text.
 
 Return: ~
     Id of the created/updated extmark

## nvim_buf_set_keymap


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(buffer: buffer, mode: string, lhs: string, rhs: string, opts?: table<string, any>)
```

 Sets a buffer-local |mapping| for the given mode.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
 
 See also: ~
   • |nvim_set_keymap()|

## nvim_buf_set_lines


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buffer: buffer, start: number, end_: number, strict_indexing: boolean, replacement: string[])
```

 Sets (replaces) a line-range in the buffer.
 
 Indexing is zero-based, end-exclusive. Negative indices are interpreted as
 length+1+index: -1 refers to the index past the end. So to change or
 delete the last element use start=-2 and end=-1.
 
 To insert lines at a given index, set `start` and `end` to the same index.
 To delete a range of lines, set `replacement` to an empty array.
 
 Out-of-bounds indices are clamped to the nearest valid value, unless
 `strict_indexing` is set.
 
 Attributes: ~
     not allowed when |textlock| is active
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}           Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {start}            First line index
   • {end}              Last line index, exclusive
   • {strict_indexing}  Whether out-of-bounds should be an error.
   • {replacement}      Array of lines to use as replacement
 
 See also: ~
   • |nvim_buf_set_text()|

## nvim_buf_set_mark


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_set_mark(buffer: buffer, name: string, line: number, col: number, opts: table<string, any>)
  -> boolean
```

 Sets a named mark in the given buffer, all marks are allowed
 file/uppercase, visual, last change, etc. See |mark-motions|.
 
 Marks are (1,0)-indexed. |api-indexing|
 
 Note:
     Passing 0 as line deletes the mark
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer to set the mark on
   • {name}    Mark name
   • {line}    Line number
   • {col}     Column/row number
   • {opts}    Optional parameters. Reserved for future use.
 
 Return: ~
     true if the mark was set, else false.
 
 See also: ~
   • |nvim_buf_del_mark()|
   • |nvim_buf_get_mark()|

## nvim_buf_set_name


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_set_name(buffer: buffer, name: string)
```

 Sets the full file name for a buffer
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {name}    Buffer name

## nvim_buf_set_option


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option(buffer: buffer, name: string, value: any)
```

 Sets a buffer option value. Passing `nil` as value deletes the option
 (only works if there's a global fallback)
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {name}    Option name
   • {value}   Option value

## nvim_buf_set_text


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(buffer: buffer, start_row: number, start_col: number, end_row: number, end_col: number, replacement: string[])
```

 Sets (replaces) a range in the buffer
 
 This is recommended over |nvim_buf_set_lines()| when only modifying parts
 of a line, as extmarks will be preserved on non-modified parts of the
 touched lines.
 
 Indexing is zero-based. Row indices are end-inclusive, and column indices
 are end-exclusive.

 lines.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}       Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
   • {start_row}    First line index
   • {start_col}    Starting column (byte offset) on first line

   • {fn}    Name of the function defined on the VimL dict
   • {args}  Function arguments packed in an Array
 
 Return: ~
     Result of the function call

## nvim_call_function


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_call_function(fn: string, args: any[])
  -> any
```

 Calls a VimL function with the given arguments.
 
 On execution error: fails with VimL error, updates v:errmsg.
 
 Parameters: ~

## nvim_chan_send


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_chan_send(chan: number, data: string)
```

 Send data to channel `id`. For a job, it writes it to the stdin of the
 process. For the stdio channel |channel-stdio|, it writes to Nvim's
 stdout. For an internal terminal instance (|nvim_open_term()|) it writes
 directly to terminal output. See |channel-bytes| for more information.
 
 This function writes raw data, not RPC messages. If the channel was
 created with `rpc=true` then the channel expects RPC messages, use
 |vim.rpcnotify()| and |vim.rpcrequest()| instead.
 
 Attributes: ~
     |RPC| only
     Lua |vim.api| only
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {chan}  id of the channel
   • {data}  data to write. 8-bit clean: can contain NUL bytes.

## nvim_clear_autocmds


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_clear_autocmds(opts?: table<string, any>)
```

 Clear all autocommands that match the corresponding {opts}. To delete a
 particular autocmd, see |nvim_del_autocmd()|.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {opts}  Parameters
             • event: (string|table) Examples:
               • event: "pat1"
               • event: { "pat1" }
               • event: { "pat1", "pat2", "pat3" }
 
             • pattern: (string|table)
               • pattern or patterns to match exactly.
                 • For example, if you have `*.py` as that pattern for the
                   autocmd, you must pass `*.py` exactly to clear it.
                   `test.py` will not match the pattern.
 
               • defaults to clearing all patterns.
               • NOTE: Cannot be used with {buffer}
 
             • buffer: (bufnr)
               • clear only |autocmd-buflocal| autocommands.
               • NOTE: Cannot be used with {pattern}
 
             • group: (string|int) The augroup name or id.
               • NOTE: If not passed, will only delete autocmds not in any group.

## nvim_cmd


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_cmd(cmd?: table<string, any>, opts?: table<string, any>)
  -> string
```

 Executes an Ex command.
 
 Unlike |nvim_command()| this command takes a structured Dictionary instead
 of a String. This allows for easier construction and manipulation of an Ex
 command. This also allows for things such as having spaces inside a
 command argument, expanding filenames in a command that otherwise doesn't
 expand filenames, etc. Command arguments may also be Number, Boolean or
 String.
 
 The first argument may also be used instead of count for commands that
 support it in order to make their usage simpler with |vim.cmd()|. For
 example, instead of `vim.cmd.bdelete{ count = 2 }`, you may do
 `vim.cmd.bdelete(2)`.
 
 On execution error: fails with VimL error, updates v:errmsg.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {cmd}   Command to execute. Must be a Dictionary that can contain the
             same values as the return value of |nvim_parse_cmd()| except
             "addr", "nargs" and "nextcmd" which are ignored if provided.
             All values except for "cmd" are optional.
   • {opts}  Optional parameters.
             • output: (boolean, default false) Whether to return command
               output.
 
 Return: ~
     Command output (non-error, non-shell |:!|) if `output` is true, else
     empty string.
 
 See also: ~
   • |nvim_exec()|
   • |nvim_command()|

## nvim_command


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_command(command: string)
```

 Executes an Ex command.
 
 On execution error: fails with VimL error, updates v:errmsg.
 
 Prefer using |nvim_cmd()| or |nvim_exec()| over this. To evaluate multiple
 lines of Vim script or an Ex command directly, use |nvim_exec()|. To
 construct an Ex command using a structured format and then execute it, use
 |nvim_cmd()|. To modify an Ex command before evaluating it, use
 |nvim_parse_cmd()| in conjunction with |nvim_cmd()|.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {command}  Ex command string

## nvim_create_augroup


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_create_augroup(name: string, opts?: table<string, any>)
  -> number
```

 Create or get an autocommand group |autocmd-groups|.
 
 To get an existing group id, do: 
 ```lua
     local id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("MyGroup", {
         clear = false
     })
 ```
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {name}  String: The name of the group
   • {opts}  Dictionary Parameters
             • clear (bool) optional: defaults to true. Clear existing
               commands if the group already exists |autocmd-groups|.
 
 Return: ~
     Integer id of the created group.
 
 See also: ~
   • |autocmd-groups|

## nvim_create_autocmd


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(event: any, opts?: table<string, any>)
  -> number
```

 Creates an |autocommand| event handler, defined by `callback` (Lua function or Vimscript function name string) or `command` (Ex command string).
 
 Example using Lua callback: 
 ```lua
     vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufEnter", "BufWinEnter"}, {
       pattern = {"*.c", "*.h"},
       callback = function(ev)
         print(string.format('event fired: s', vim.inspect(ev)))
       end
     })
 ```
 
 Example using an Ex command as the handler: 
 ```lua
     vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufEnter", "BufWinEnter"}, {
       pattern = {"*.c", "*.h"},
       command = "echo 'Entering a C or C++ file'",
     })
 ```
 
 Note: `pattern` is NOT automatically expanded (unlike with |:autocmd|), thus names like
 "$HOME" and "~" must be expanded explicitly: 
 ```lua
   pattern = vim.fn.expand("~") .. "/some/path/*.py"
 ```
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {event}  (string|array) Event(s) that will trigger the handler
              (`callback` or `command`).
   • {opts}   Options dict:
              • group (string|integer) optional: autocommand group name or
                id to match against.
              • pattern (string|array) optional: pattern(s) to match
                literally |autocmd-pattern|.
              • buffer (integer) optional: buffer number for buffer-local
                autocommands |autocmd-buflocal|. Cannot be used with
                {pattern}.
              • desc (string) optional: description (for documentation and
                troubleshooting).
              • callback (function|string) optional: Lua function (or
                Vimscript function name, if string) called when the
                event(s) is triggered. Lua callback can return true to
                delete the autocommand, and receives a table argument with
                these keys:
                • id: (number) autocommand id
                • event: (string) name of the triggered event
                  |autocmd-events|
                • group: (number|nil) autocommand group id, if any

                  |nvim_exec_autocmds()|
 
              • command (string) optional: Vim command to execute on event.
                Cannot be used with {callback}
              • once (boolean) optional: defaults to false. Run the
                autocommand only once |autocmd-once|.
              • nested (boolean) optional: defaults to false. Run nested
                autocommands |autocmd-nested|.
 
 Return: ~
     Autocommand id (number)

 "name" can contain wildcards. For example
 nvim_get_runtime_file("colors/*.vim", true) will return all color scheme
 files. Always use forward slashes (/) in the search pattern for
 subdirectories regardless of platform.
 
 It is not an error to not find any files. An empty array is returned then.
 
 Attributes: ~
     |api-fast|

## nvim_input


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_input(keys: string)
  -> number
```

 Queues raw user-input. Unlike |nvim_feedkeys()|, this uses a low-level
 input buffer and the call is non-blocking (input is processed
 asynchronously by the eventloop).
 
 On execution error: does not fail, but updates v:errmsg.
 
 Note:
     |keycodes| like <CR> are translated, so "<" is special. To input a
     literal "<", send <LT>.
 
 Note:
     For mouse events use |nvim_input_mouse()|. The pseudokey form
     "<LeftMouse><col,row>" is deprecated since |api-level| 6.
 
 Attributes: ~
     |api-fast|
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {keys}  to be typed
 
 Return: ~
     Number of bytes actually written (can be fewer than requested if the
     buffer becomes full).

## nvim_input_mouse


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_input_mouse(button: string, action: string, modifier: string, grid: number, row: number, col: number)
```

 Send mouse event from GUI.
 
 Non-blocking: does not wait on any result, but queues the event to be
 processed soon by the event loop.
 
 Note:
     Currently this doesn't support "scripting" multiple mouse events by
     calling it multiple times in a loop: the intermediate mouse positions
     will be ignored. It should be used to implement real-time mouse input
     in a GUI. The deprecated pseudokey form ("<LeftMouse><col,row>") of
     |nvim_input()| has the same limitation.
 
 Attributes: ~
     |api-fast|
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {button}    Mouse button: one of "left", "right", "middle", "wheel",
                 "move".
   • {action}    For ordinary buttons, one of "press", "drag", "release".
                 For the wheel, one of "up", "down", "left", "right".
                 Ignored for "move".
   • {modifier}  String of modifiers each represented by a single char. The
                 same specifiers are used as for a key press, except that
                 the "-" separator is optional, so "C-A-", "c-a" and "CA"
                 can all be used to specify Ctrl+Alt+click.
   • {grid}      Grid number if the client uses |ui-multigrid|, else 0.
   • {row}       Mouse row-position (zero-based, like redraw events)
   • {col}       Mouse column-position (zero-based, like redraw events)

## nvim_list_bufs


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_list_bufs()

## nvim_list_wins


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_list_wins()

## nvim_notify


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_notify(msg: string, log_level: number, opts: table<string, any>)
  -> any
```

 Notify the user with a message
 
 Relays the call to vim.notify . By default forwards your message in the
 echo area but can be overridden to trigger desktop notifications.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {msg}        Message to display to the user
   • {log_level}  The log level
   • {opts}       Reserved for future use.

## nvim_open_term


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_open_term(buffer: buffer, opts: table<string, any>)
  -> number
```

 Open a terminal instance in a buffer
 
 By default (and currently the only option) the terminal will not be
 connected to an external process. Instead, input send on the channel will
 be echoed directly by the terminal. This is useful to display ANSI
 terminal sequences returned as part of a rpc message, or similar.
 
 Note: to directly initiate the terminal using the right size, display the
 buffer in a configured window before calling this. For instance, for a
 floating display, first create an empty buffer using |nvim_create_buf()|,
 then display it using |nvim_open_win()|, and then call this function. Then
 |nvim_chan_send()| can be called immediately to process sequences in a
 virtual terminal having the intended size.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  the buffer to use (expected to be empty)
   • {opts}    Optional parameters.
               • on_input: lua callback for input sent, i e keypresses in
                 terminal mode. Note: keypresses are sent raw as they would
                 be to the pty master end. For instance, a carriage return
                 is sent as a "\r", not as a "\n". |textlock| applies. It
                 is possible to call |nvim_chan_send()| directly in the
                 callback however. ["input", term, bufnr, data]
 
 Return: ~
     Channel id, or 0 on error

## nvim_open_win


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_open_win(buffer: buffer, enter: boolean, config?: table<string, any>)
  -> window
```

 Open a new window.
 
 Currently this is used to open floating and external windows. Floats are
 windows that are drawn above the split layout, at some anchor position in
 some other window. Floats can be drawn internally or by external GUI with
 the |ui-multigrid| extension. External windows are only supported with
 multigrid GUIs, and are displayed as separate top-level windows.
 
 For a general overview of floats, see |api-floatwin|.
 
 Exactly one of `external` and `relative` must be specified. The `width`
 and `height` of the new window must be specified.
 
 With relative=editor (row=0,col=0) refers to the top-left corner of the
 screen-grid and (row=Lines-1,col=Columns-1) refers to the bottom-right
 corner. Fractional values are allowed, but the builtin implementation
 (used by non-multigrid UIs) will always round down to nearest integer.
 
 Out-of-bounds values, and configurations that make the float not fit
 inside the main editor, are allowed. The builtin implementation truncates
 values so floats are fully within the main screen grid. External GUIs
 could let floats hover outside of the main window like a tooltip, but this
 should not be used to specify arbitrary WM screen positions.
 
 Example (Lua): window-relative float 
 ```lua
     vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false,
       {relative='win', row=3, col=3, width=12, height=3})
 ```
 
 Example (Lua): buffer-relative float (travels as buffer is scrolled) 
 ```lua
     vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false,
       {relative='win', width=12, height=3, bufpos={100,10}})
 ```
 
 Attributes: ~
     not allowed when |textlock| is active
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {buffer}  Buffer to display, or 0 for current buffer
   • {enter}   Enter the window (make it the current window)
   • {config}  Map defining the window configuration. Keys:
               • relative: Sets the window layout to "floating", placed at
                 (row,col) coordinates relative to:
                 • "editor" The global editor grid
                 • "win" Window given by the `win` field, or current
                   window.
                 • "cursor" Cursor position in current window.
                 • "mouse" Mouse position
 
               • win: |window-ID| for relative="win".
               • anchor: Decides which corner of the float to place at
                 (row,col):
                 • "NW" northwest (default)
                 • "NE" northeast
                 • "SW" southwest
                 • "SE" southeast
 
               • width: Window width (in character cells). Minimum of 1.
               • height: Window height (in character cells). Minimum of 1.
               • bufpos: Places float relative to buffer text (only when
                 relative="win"). Takes a tuple of zero-indexed [line,
                 column]. `row` and `col` if given are applied relative to this position, else they
                 default to:
                 • `row=1` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "NW" or "NE"
                 • `row=0` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "SW" or "SE" (thus
                   like a tooltip near the buffer text).
 
               • row: Row position in units of "screen cell height", may be
                 fractional.
               • col: Column position in units of "screen cell width", may
                 be fractional.
               • focusable: Enable focus by user actions (wincmds, mouse
                 events). Defaults to true. Non-focusable windows can be
                 entered by |nvim_set_current_win()|.
               • external: GUI should display the window as an external
                 top-level window. Currently accepts no other positioning
                 configuration together with this.
               • zindex: Stacking order. floats with higher `zindex` go on top on floats with lower indices. Must be larger
                 than zero. The following screen elements have hard-coded
                 z-indices:
                 • 100: insert completion popupmenu
                 • 200: message scrollback
                 • 250: cmdline completion popupmenu (when
                   wildoptions+=pum) The default value for floats are 50.
                   In general, values below 100 are recommended, unless
                   there is a good reason to overshadow builtin elements.
 
               • style: Configure the appearance of the window. Currently
                 only takes one non-empty value:
                 • "minimal" Nvim will display the window with many UI
                   options disabled. This is useful when displaying a
                   temporary float where the text should not be edited.
                   Disables 'number', 'relativenumber', 'cursorline',
                   'cursorcolumn', 'foldcolumn', 'spell' and 'list'
                   options. 'signcolumn' is changed to `auto` and
                   'colorcolumn' is cleared. 'statuscolumn' is changed to
                   empty. The end-of-buffer region is hidden by setting
                   `eob` flag of 'fillchars' to a space char, and clearing
                   the |hl-EndOfBuffer| region in 'winhighlight'.
 
               • border: Style of (optional) window border. This can either
                 be a string or an array. The string values are
                 • "none": No border (default).
                 • "single": A single line box.
                 • "double": A double line box.
                 • "rounded": Like "single", but with rounded corners ("╭"
                   etc.).
                 • "solid": Adds padding by a single whitespace cell.
                 • "shadow": A drop shadow effect by blending with the
                   background.
                 • If it is an array, it should have a length of eight or
                   any divisor of eight. The array will specifify the eight
                   chars building up the border in a clockwise fashion
                   starting with the top-left corner. As an example, the
                   double box style could be specified as [ "╔", "═" ,"╗",
                   "║", "╝", "═", "╚", "║" ]. If the number of chars are
                   less than eight, they will be repeated. Thus an ASCII
                   border could be specified as [ "/", "-", "\\", "|" ], or
                   all chars the same as [ "x" ]. An empty string can be
                   used to turn off a specific border, for instance, [ "",
                   "", "", ">", "", "", "", "<" ] will only make vertical
                   borders but not horizontal ones. By default,
                   `FloatBorder` highlight is used, which links to
                   `WinSeparator` when not defined. It could also be
                   specified by character: [ ["+", "MyCorner"], ["x",
                   "MyBorder"] ].
 
               • title: Title (optional) in window border, String or list.
                 List is [text, highlight] tuples. if is string the default
                 highlight group is `FloatTitle`.
               • title_pos: Title position must set with title option.
                 value can be of `left` `center` `right` default is left.
               • noautocmd: If true then no buffer-related autocommand
                 events such as |BufEnter|, |BufLeave| or |BufWinEnter| may
                 fire from calling this function.

   • {flags}      Flags:
                  • "m" if multiple expressions in a row are allowed (only
                    the first one will be parsed),
                  • "E" if EOC tokens are not allowed (determines whether
                    they will stop parsing process or be recognized as an
                    operator/space, though also yielding an error).
                  • "l" when needing to start parsing with lvalues for
                    ":let" or ":for". Common flag sets:

                  containing array of 4-tuples (arrays) (Integer, Integer,
                  Integer, String), where first three numbers define the
                  highlighted region and represent line, starting column
                  and ending column (latter exclusive: one should highlight
                  region [start_col, end_col)).
 
 Return: ~
 
     • AST: top-level dictionary with these keys:
       • "error": Dictionary with error, present only if parser saw some
         error. Contains the following keys:
         • "message": String, error message in printf format, translated.
           Must contain exactly one "%.*s".
         • "arg": String, error message argument.
 
       • "len": Amount of bytes successfully parsed. With flags equal to ""
         that should be equal to the length of expr string. (“Successfully
         parsed” here means “participated in AST creation”, not “till the
         first error”.)
       • "ast": AST, either nil or a dictionary with these keys:
         • "type": node type, one of the value names from ExprASTNodeType
           stringified without "kExprNode" prefix.
         • "start": a pair [line, column] describing where node is

           yet). Both elements are Integers.
         • "len": “length” of the node. This and "start" are there for
           debugging purposes primary (debugging parser and providing debug
           information).
         • "children": a list of nodes described in top/"ast". There always
           is zero, one or two children, key will not be present if node
           has no children. Maximum number of children may be found in
           node_maxchildren array.
 
     • Local values (present only for certain nodes):
       • "scope": a single Integer, specifies scope for "Option" and
         "PlainIdentifier" nodes. For "Option" it is one of ExprOptScope
         values, for "PlainIdentifier" it is one of ExprVarScope values.
       • "ident": identifier (without scope, if any), present for "Option",
         "PlainIdentifier", "PlainKey" and "Environment" nodes.
       • "name": Integer, register name (one character) or -1. Only present

## nvim_paste


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_paste(data: string, crlf: boolean, phase: number)
  -> boolean
```

 Pastes at cursor, in any mode.
 
 Invokes the `vim.paste` handler, which handles each mode appropriately.
 Sets redo/undo. Faster than |nvim_input()|. Lines break at LF ("\n").
 
 Errors ('nomodifiable', `vim.paste()` failure, …) are reflected in `err`
 but do not affect the return value (which is strictly decided by
 `vim.paste()`). On error, subsequent calls are ignored ("drained") until
 the next paste is initiated (phase 1 or -1).
 
 Attributes: ~
     not allowed when |textlock| is active
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {data}   Multiline input. May be binary (containing NUL bytes).
   • {crlf}   Also break lines at CR and CRLF.
   • {phase}  -1: paste in a single call (i.e. without streaming). To
              "stream" a paste, call `nvim_paste` sequentially with these `phase` values:
              • 1: starts the paste (exactly once)
              • 2: continues the paste (zero or more times)
              • 3: ends the paste (exactly once)
 
 Return: ~
 
     • true: Client may continue pasting.
     • false: Client must cancel the paste.

## nvim_put


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_put(lines: string[], type: string, after: boolean, follow: boolean)
```

 Puts text at cursor, in any mode.
 
 Compare |:put| and |p| which are always linewise.
 
 Attributes: ~
     not allowed when |textlock| is active
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {lines}   |readfile()|-style list of lines. |channel-lines|
   • {type}    Edit behavior: any |getregtype()| result, or:
               • "b" |blockwise-visual| mode (may include width, e.g. "b3")
               • "c" |charwise| mode
               • "l" |linewise| mode
               • "" guess by contents, see |setreg()|
   • {after}   If true insert after cursor (like |p|), or before (like
               |P|).
   • {follow}  If true place cursor at end of inserted text.

## nvim_replace_termcodes


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes(str: string, from_part: boolean, do_lt: boolean, special: boolean)
  -> string
```

 Replaces terminal codes and |keycodes| (<CR>, <Esc>, ...) in a string with
 the internal representation.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {str}        String to be converted.
   • {from_part}  Legacy Vim parameter. Usually true.
   • {do_lt}      Also translate <lt>. Ignored if `special` is false.
   • {special}    Replace |keycodes|, e.g. <CR> becomes a "\r" char.
 
 See also: ~
   • replace_termcodes
   • cpoptions

## nvim_select_popupmenu_item


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_select_popupmenu_item(item: number, insert: boolean, finish: boolean, opts: table<string, any>)
```

 Selects an item in the completion popup menu.
 
 If neither |ins-completion| nor |cmdline-completion| popup menu is active
 this API call is silently ignored. Useful for an external UI using
 |ui-popupmenu| to control the popup menu with the mouse. Can also be used
 in a mapping; use <Cmd> |:map-cmd| or a Lua mapping to ensure the mapping
 doesn't end completion mode.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {item}    Index (zero-based) of the item to select. Value of -1
               selects nothing and restores the original text.
   • {insert}  For |ins-completion|, whether the selection should be
               inserted in the buffer. Ignored for |cmdline-completion|.
   • {finish}  Finish the completion and dismiss the popup menu. Implies
               {insert}.
   • {opts}    Optional parameters. Reserved for future use.

 Parameters: ~
   • {line}  Line contents

## nvim_set_current_tabpage


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_set_current_tabpage(tabpage: tabpage)
```

 Sets the current tabpage.
 
 Attributes: ~
     not allowed when |textlock| is active
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {tabpage}  Tabpage handle

## nvim_set_current_win


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_set_current_win(window: window)
```

 Sets the current window.
 
 Attributes: ~
     not allowed when |textlock| is active
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {window}  Window handle

## nvim_set_decoration_provider


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_set_decoration_provider(ns_id: number, opts?: table<string, any>)
```

 Set or change decoration provider for a |namespace|
 
 This is a very general purpose interface for having lua callbacks being
 triggered during the redraw code.
 
 The expected usage is to set |extmarks| for the currently redrawn buffer.
 |nvim_buf_set_extmark()| can be called to add marks on a per-window or
 per-lines basis. Use the `ephemeral` key to only use the mark for the
 current screen redraw (the callback will be called again for the next
 redraw ).
 
 Note: this function should not be called often. Rather, the callbacks
 themselves can be used to throttle unneeded callbacks. the `on_start`
 callback can return `false` to disable the provider until the next redraw.
 Similarly, return `false` in `on_win` will skip the `on_lines` calls for
 that window (but any extmarks set in `on_win` will still be used). A
 plugin managing multiple sources of decoration should ideally only set one
 provider, and merge the sources internally. You can use multiple `ns_id`
 for the extmarks set/modified inside the callback anyway.
 
 Note: doing anything other than setting extmarks is considered
 experimental. Doing things like changing options are not expliticly
 forbidden, but is likely to have unexpected consequences (such as 100% CPU
 consumption). doing `vim.rpcnotify` should be OK, but `vim.rpcrequest` is
 quite dubious for the moment.
 
 Attributes: ~
     Lua |vim.api| only
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {ns_id}  Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
   • {opts}   Table of callbacks:
              • on_start: called first on each screen redraw ["start",
                tick]
              • on_buf: called for each buffer being redrawn (before window
                callbacks) ["buf", bufnr, tick]
              • on_win: called when starting to redraw a specific window.
                ["win", winid, bufnr, topline, botline_guess]
              • on_line: called for each buffer line being redrawn. (The
                interaction with fold lines is subject to change) ["win",
                winid, bufnr, row]
              • on_end: called at the end of a redraw cycle ["end", tick]

## nvim_set_hl


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_set_hl(ns_id: number, name: string, val?: table<string, any>)
```

 Sets a highlight group.
 
 Note:
     Unlike the `:highlight` command which can update a highlight group,
     this function completely replaces the definition. For example:
     `nvim_set_hl(0, 'Visual', {})` will clear the highlight group
     'Visual'.
 
 Note:
     The fg and bg keys also accept the string values `"fg"` or `"bg"`
     which act as aliases to the corresponding foreground and background
     values of the Normal group. If the Normal group has not been defined,
     using these values results in an error.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {ns_id}  Namespace id for this highlight |nvim_create_namespace()|.
              Use 0 to set a highlight group globally |:highlight|.
              Highlights from non-global namespaces are not active by
              default, use |nvim_set_hl_ns()| or |nvim_win_set_hl_ns()| to
              activate them.
   • {name}   Highlight group name, e.g. "ErrorMsg"
   • {val}    Highlight definition map, accepts the following keys:
              • fg (or foreground): color name or "#RRGGBB", see note.
              • bg (or background): color name or "#RRGGBB", see note.
              • sp (or special): color name or "#RRGGBB"
              • blend: integer between 0 and 100
              • bold: boolean
              • standout: boolean
              • underline: boolean
              • undercurl: boolean
              • underdouble: boolean

              • underdashed: boolean
              • strikethrough: boolean
              • italic: boolean
              • reverse: boolean
              • nocombine: boolean
              • link: name of another highlight group to link to, see
                |:hi-link|.
              • default: Don't override existing definition |:hi-default|
              • ctermfg: Sets foreground of cterm color |ctermfg|
              • ctermbg: Sets background of cterm color |ctermbg|
              • cterm: cterm attribute map, like |highlight-args|. If not
                set, cterm attributes will match those from the attribute
                map documented above.

## nvim_set_hl_ns


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_set_hl_ns(ns_id: number)
```

 Set active namespace for highlights defined with |nvim_set_hl()|. This can
 be set for a single window, see |nvim_win_set_hl_ns()|.
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {ns_id}  the namespace to use

## nvim_set_hl_ns_fast


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_set_hl_ns_fast(ns_id: number)
```

 Set active namespace for highlights defined with |nvim_set_hl()| while
 redrawing.
 
 This function meant to be called while redrawing, primarily from
 |nvim_set_decoration_provider()| on_win and on_line callbacks, which are
 allowed to change the namespace during a redraw cycle.
 
 Attributes: ~
     |api-fast|
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {ns_id}  the namespace to activate

## nvim_set_keymap


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(mode: string, lhs: string, rhs: string, opts?: table<string, any>)
```

 Sets a global |mapping| for the given mode.
 
 To set a buffer-local mapping, use |nvim_buf_set_keymap()|.
 
 Unlike |:map|, leading/trailing whitespace is accepted as part of the
 {lhs} or {rhs}. Empty {rhs} is |<Nop>|. |keycodes| are replaced as usual.
 
 Example: 
 ```vim
     call nvim_set_keymap('n', ' <NL>', '', {'nowait': v:true})
 ```
 
 is equivalent to: 
 ```vim
     nmap <nowait> <Space><NL> <Nop>
 ```
 
 Parameters: ~
   • {mode}  Mode short-name (map command prefix: "n", "i", "v", "x", …) or
             "!" for |:map!|, or empty string for |:map|.
   • {lhs}   Left-hand-side |{lhs}| of the mapping.
   • {rhs}   Right-hand-side |{rhs}| of the mapping.
   • {opts}  Optional parameters map: Accepts all |:map-arguments| as keys
             except |<buffer>|, values are booleans (default false). Also:
             • "noremap" non-recursive mapping |:noremap|
             • "desc" human-readable description.
             • "callback" Lua function called when the mapping is executed.
             • "replace_keycodes" (boolean) When "expr" is true, replace
               keycodes in the resulting string (see
               |nvim_replace_termcodes()|). Returning nil from the Lua
               "callback" is equivalent to returning an empty string.

## nvim_set_option

## nvim_set_option_value


```lua
function vim.api.nvim_set_option_value(name: string, value: any, opts?: table<string, any>)
```

 Parameters: ~
   • {name}   Option name
   • {value}  New option value
   • {opts}   Optional parameters

# vim.bo

## ai


```lua
boolean
```

## ar


```lua
boolean
```

## autoindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autoindent'`  `'ai'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	Copy indent from current line when starting a new line (typing <CR>
 	in Insert mode or when using the "o" or "O" command).  If you do not
 	type anything on the new line except <BS> or CTRL-D and then type
 	<Esc>, CTRL-O or <CR>, the indent is deleted again.  Moving the cursor
 	to another line has the same effect, unless the `'I'`  flag is included
 	in `'cpoptions'` .
 	When autoindent is on, formatting (with the "gq" command or when you
 	reach `'textwidth'`  in Insert mode) uses the indentation of the first
 	line.
 	When `'smartindent'`  or `'cindent'`  is on the indent is changed in
 	a different way.
 	{small difference from Vi: After the indent is deleted when typing
 	<Esc> or <CR>, the cursor position when moving up or down is after the
 	deleted indent; Vi puts the cursor somewhere in the deleted indent}.

## autoread


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autoread'`  `'ar'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	When a file has been detected to have been changed outside of Vim and
 	it has not been changed inside of Vim, automatically read it again.
 	When the file has been deleted this is not done, so you have the text
 	from before it was deleted.  When it appears again then it is read.
 	|timestamp|
 	If this option has a local value, use this command to switch back to
 	using the global value: >
 		:set autoread<
 <

## backupcopy


```lua
string
```

 `'backupcopy'`  `'bkc'` 	string	(default: "auto")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
 	done.  This is a comma-separated list of words.
 
 	The main values are:
 	"yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
 	"no"	rename the file and write a new one
 	"auto"	one of the previous, what works best
 
 	Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
 	"breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
 	"breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing
 
 	Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
 	- Takes extra time to copy the file.
 	+ When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
 	  has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
 	- When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
 	  not of the real file.
 
 	Renaming the file and writing a new one:
 	+ It's fast.
 	- Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
 	  file.
 	- When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.
 
 	The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming the
 	file is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on
 	and the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected,
 	a copy will be made.
 
 	The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
 	combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
 	force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
 	exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
 	become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
 	useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
 	hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
 	be propagated back to the original source.
 
 	One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
 	that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
 	the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
 	backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
 	example.
 
 	When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
 	with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
 	symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file,
 	however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
 	group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
 	fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
 	others.
 
 	When the file is renamed, this is the other way around: The backup has
 	the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
 	is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
 	link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
 	rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
 	written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
 	the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
 	again not rename the file.

## bh


```lua
string
```

## bin


```lua
boolean
```

## binary


```lua
boolean
```

 `'binary'`  `'bin'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	This option should be set before editing a binary file.  You can also
 	use the |-b| Vim argument.  When this option is switched on a few
 	options will be changed (also when it already was on):
 		`'textwidth'`   will be set to 0
 		`'wrapmargin'`  will be set to 0
 		`'modeline'`    will be off
 		`'expandtab'`   will be off
 	Also, `'fileformat'`  and `'fileformats'`  options will not be used, the
 	file is read and written like `'fileformat'`  was "unix" (a single <NL>
 	separates lines).
 	The `'fileencoding'`  and `'fileencodings'`  options will not be used, the
 	file is read without conversion.
 	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the `'bin'`  option is
 	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
 	`'textwidth'` ), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
 	`'bin'`  again when the file has been loaded.
 	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when
 	`'bin'`  is switched from on to off.  Each buffer has its own set of
 	saved option values.
 	To edit a file with `'binary'`  set you can use the |++bin| argument.
 	This avoids you have to do ":set bin", which would have effect for all
 	files you edit.
 	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
 	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
 	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See
 	the `'endofline'`  option.

## bkc


```lua
string
```

## bl


```lua
boolean
```

## bomb


```lua
boolean
```

 `'bomb'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When writing a file and the following conditions are met, a BOM (Byte
 	Order Mark) is prepended to the file:
 	- this option is on
 	- the `'binary'`  option is off
 	- `'fileencoding'`  is "utf-8", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" or one of the little/big
 	  endian variants.
 	Some applications use the BOM to recognize the encoding of the file.
 	Often used for UCS-2 files on MS-Windows.  For other applications it
 	causes trouble, for example: "cat file1 file2" makes the BOM of file2
 	appear halfway through the resulting file.  Gcc doesn't accept a BOM.
 	When Vim reads a file and `'fileencodings'`  starts with "ucs-bom", a
 	check for the presence of the BOM is done and `'bomb'`  set accordingly.
 	Unless `'binary'`  is set, it is removed from the first line, so that you
 	don't see it when editing.  When you don't change the options, the BOM
 	will be restored when writing the file.

## bt


```lua
string
```

## bufhidden


```lua
string
```

 `'bufhidden'`  `'bh'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies what happens when a buffer is no longer
 	displayed in a window:
 	  <empty>	follow the global `'hidden'`  option
 	  hide		hide the buffer (don't unload it), even if `'hidden'`  is
 			not set
 	  unload	unload the buffer, even if `'hidden'`  is set; the
 			|:hide| command will also unload the buffer
 	  delete	delete the buffer from the buffer list, even if
 			`'hidden'`  is set; the |:hide| command will also delete
 			the buffer, making it behave like |:bdelete|
 	  wipe		wipe the buffer from the buffer list, even if
 			`'hidden'`  is set; the |:hide| command will also wipe
 			out the buffer, making it behave like |:bwipeout|
 
 	CAREFUL: when "unload", "delete" or "wipe" is used changes in a buffer
 	are lost without a warning.  Also, these values may break autocommands
 	that switch between buffers temporarily.
 	This option is used together with `'buftype'`  and `'swapfile'`  to specify
 	special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

## buflisted


```lua
boolean
```

 `'buflisted'`  `'bl'` 	boolean (default: on)
 			local to buffer
 	When this option is set, the buffer shows up in the buffer list.  If
 	it is reset it is not used for ":bnext", "ls", the Buffers menu, etc.
 	This option is reset by Vim for buffers that are only used to remember
 	a file name or marks.  Vim sets it when starting to edit a buffer.
 	But not when moving to a buffer with ":buffer".

## buftype


```lua
string
```

 `'buftype'`  `'bt'` 		string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	The value of this option specifies the type of a buffer:
 	  <empty>	normal buffer
 	  acwrite	buffer will always be written with |BufWriteCmd|s
 	  help		help buffer (do not set this manually)
 	  nofile	buffer is not related to a file, will not be written
 	  nowrite	buffer will not be written
 	  quickfix	list of errors |:cwindow| or locations |:lwindow|
 	  terminal	|terminal-emulator| buffer
 	  prompt	buffer where only the last line can be edited, meant
 			to be used by a plugin, see |prompt-buffer|
 
 	This option is used together with `'bufhidden'`  and `'swapfile'`  to
 	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.
 	Also see |win_gettype()|, which returns the type of the window.
 
 	Be careful with changing this option, it can have many side effects!
 	One such effect is that Vim will not check the timestamp of the file,
 	if the file is changed by another program this will not be noticed.
 
 	A "quickfix" buffer is only used for the error list and the location
 	list.  This value is set by the |:cwindow| and |:lwindow| commands and
 	you are not supposed to change it.
 
 	"nofile" and "nowrite" buffers are similar:
 	both:		The buffer is not to be written to disk, ":w" doesn't
 			work (":w filename" does work though).
 	both:		The buffer is never considered to be |`'modified'` |.
 			There is no warning when the changes will be lost, for
 			example when you quit Vim.
 	both:		A swap file is only created when using too much memory
 			(when `'swapfile'`  has been reset there is never a swap
 			file).
 	nofile only:	The buffer name is fixed, it is not handled like a
 			file name.  It is not modified in response to a |:cd|
 			command.
 	both:		When using ":e bufname" and already editing "bufname"
 			the buffer is made empty and autocommands are
 			triggered as usual for |:edit|.
 
 	"acwrite" implies that the buffer name is not related to a file, like
 	"nofile", but it will be written.  Thus, in contrast to "nofile" and
 	"nowrite", ":w" does work and a modified buffer can't be abandoned
 	without saving.  For writing there must be matching |BufWriteCmd|,
 	|FileWriteCmd| or |FileAppendCmd| autocommands.

## cfu


```lua
string
```

## channel


```lua
integer
```

 `'channel'` 		number (default: 0)
 			local to buffer
 	|channel| connected to the buffer, or 0 if no channel is connected.
 	In a |:terminal| buffer this is the terminal channel.
 	Read-only.

## ci


```lua
boolean
```

## cin


```lua
boolean
```

## cindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'cindent'`  `'cin'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Enables automatic C program indenting.  See `'cinkeys'`  to set the keys
 	that trigger reindenting in insert mode and `'cinoptions'`  to set your
 	preferred indent style.
 	If `'indentexpr'`  is not empty, it overrules `'cindent'` .
 	If `'lisp'`  is not on and both `'indentexpr'`  and `'equalprg'`  are empty,
 	the "=" operator indents using this algorithm rather than calling an
 	external program.
 	See |C-indenting|.
 	When you don't like the way `'cindent'`  works, try the `'smartindent'` 
 	option or `'indentexpr'` .

## cink


```lua
string
```

## cinkeys


```lua
string
```

 `'cinkeys'`  `'cink'` 	string	(default "0{,0},0),0],:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
 			local to buffer
 	A list of keys that, when typed in Insert mode, cause reindenting of
 	the current line.  Only used if `'cindent'`  is on and `'indentexpr'`  is
 	empty.
 	For the format of this option see |cinkeys-format|.
 	See |C-indenting|.

## cino


```lua
string
```

## cinoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'cinoptions'`  `'cino'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	The `'cinoptions'`  affect the way `'cindent'`  reindents lines in a C
 	program.  See |cinoptions-values| for the values of this option, and
 	|C-indenting| for info on C indenting in general.

## cinscopedecls


```lua
string
```

 `'cinscopedecls'`  `'cinsd'` 	string	(default "public,protected,private")
 			local to buffer
 	Keywords that are interpreted as a C++ scope declaration by |cino-g|.
 	Useful e.g. for working with the Qt framework that defines additional
 	scope declarations "signals", "public slots" and "private slots": >
 		set cinscopedecls+=signals,public\ slots,private\ slots
 
 <

## cinsd


```lua
string
```

## cinw


```lua
string
```

## cinwords


```lua
string
```

 `'cinwords'`  `'cinw'` 	string	(default "if,else,while,do,for,switch")
 			local to buffer
 	These keywords start an extra indent in the next line when
 	`'smartindent'`  or `'cindent'`  is set.  For `'cindent'`  this is only done at
 	an appropriate place (inside {}).
 	Note that `'ignorecase'`  isn't used for `'cinwords'` .  If case doesn't
 	matter, include the keyword both the uppercase and lowercase:
 	"if,If,IF".

## cms


```lua
string
```

## com


```lua
string
```

## comments


```lua
string
```

 `'comments'`  `'com'` 	string	(default
 				"s1:/,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-")
 			local to buffer
 	A comma-separated list of strings that can start a comment line.  See
 	|format-comments|.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes to
 	insert a space.

## commentstring


```lua
string
```

 `'commentstring'`  `'cms'` 	string	(default "//")
 			local to buffer
 	A template for a comment.  The "%s" in the value is replaced with the
 	comment text.  Currently only used to add markers for folding, see
 	|fold-marker|.

## complete


```lua
string
```

 `'complete'`  `'cpt'` 	string	(default: ".,w,b,u,t")
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies how keyword completion |ins-completion| works
 	when CTRL-P or CTRL-N are used.  It is also used for whole-line
 	completion |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L|.  It indicates the type of completion
 	and the places to scan.  It is a comma-separated list of flags:
 	.	scan the current buffer (`'wrapscan'`  is ignored)
 	w	scan buffers from other windows
 	b	scan other loaded buffers that are in the buffer list
 	u	scan the unloaded buffers that are in the buffer list
 	U	scan the buffers that are not in the buffer list
 	k	scan the files given with the `'dictionary'`  option
 	kspell  use the currently active spell checking |spell|
 	k{dict}	scan the file {dict}.  Several "k" flags can be given,
 		patterns are valid too.  For example: >
 			:set cpt=k/usr/dict/*,k~/spanish
 <	s	scan the files given with the `'thesaurus'`  option
 	s{tsr}	scan the file {tsr}.  Several "s" flags can be given, patterns
 		are valid too.
 	i	scan current and included files
 	d	scan current and included files for defined name or macro
 		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D|
 	]	tag completion
 	t	same as "]"
 
 	Unloaded buffers are not loaded, thus their autocmds |:autocmd| are
 	not executed, this may lead to unexpected completions from some files
 	(gzipped files for example).  Unloaded buffers are not scanned for
 	whole-line completion.
 
 	As you can see, CTRL-N and CTRL-P can be used to do any `'iskeyword'` -
 	based expansion (e.g., dictionary |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|, included patterns
 	|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I|, tags |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]| and normal expansions).

## completefunc


```lua
string
```

 `'completefunc'`  `'cfu'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode completion
 	with CTRL-X CTRL-U. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|
 	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
 	invoked and what it should return.  The value can be the name of a
 	function, a |lambda| or a |Funcref|. See |option-value-function| for
 	more information.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## copyindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'copyindent'`  `'ci'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Copy the structure of the existing lines indent when autoindenting a
 	new line.  Normally the new indent is reconstructed by a series of
 	tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |`'expandtab'` | is enabled,
 	in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option makes the
 	new line copy whatever characters were used for indenting on the
 	existing line.  `'expandtab'`  has no effect on these characters, a Tab
 	remains a Tab.  If the new indent is greater than on the existing
 	line, the remaining space is filled in the normal manner.
 	See `'preserveindent'` .

## cpt


```lua
string
```

## def


```lua
string
```

## define


```lua
string
```

 `'define'`  `'def'` 		string	(default "^\sdefine")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Pattern to be used to find a macro definition.  It is a search
 	pattern, just like for the "/" command.  This option is used for the
 	commands like "[i" and "[d" |include-search|.  The `'isident'`  option is
 	used to recognize the defined name after the match:
 		{match with `'define'` }{non-ID chars}{defined name}{non-ID char}
 	See |option-backslash| about inserting backslashes to include a space
 	or backslash.
 	The default value is for C programs.  For C++ this value would be
 	useful, to include const type declarations: >
 		^\(#\s\s[a-z]*\)
 <	You can also use "\ze" just before the name and continue the pattern
 	to check what is following.  E.g. for Javascript, if a function is
 	defined with `func_name = function(args)`: >
 		^\s=\s*function(
 <	If the function is defined with `func_name : function() {...`: >
 	        ^\s[:]\sfunction\s*(
 <	When using the ":set" command, you need to double the backslashes!
 	To avoid that use `:let` with a single quote string: >
 		let &l:define = `'^\s=\s*function('` 
 <

## dict


```lua
string
```

## dictionary


```lua
string
```

 `'dictionary'`  `'dict'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
 	for keyword completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|.  Each file should
 	contain a list of words.  This can be one word per line, or several
 	words per line, separated by non-keyword characters (white space is
 	preferred).  Maximum line length is 510 bytes.
 
 	When this option is empty or an entry "spell" is present, and spell
 	checking is enabled, words in the word lists for the currently active
 	`'spelllang'`  are used. See |spell|.
 
 	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
 	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
 	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
 	This has nothing to do with the |Dictionary| variable type.
 	Where to find a list of words?
 	- BSD/macOS include the "/usr/share/dict/words" file.
 	- Try "apt install spell" to get the "/usr/share/dict/words" file on
 	  apt-managed systems (Debian/Ubuntu).
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.
 	Backticks cannot be used in this option for security reasons.

## efm


```lua
string
```

## endoffile


```lua
boolean
```

 `'endoffile'`  `'eof'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Indicates that a CTRL-Z character was found at the end of the file
 	when reading it.  Normally only happens when `'fileformat'`  is "dos".
 	When writing a file and this option is off and the `'binary'`  option
 	is on, or `'fixeol'`  option is off, no CTRL-Z will be written at the
 	end of the file.
 	See |eol-and-eof| for example settings.

## endofline


```lua
boolean
```

 `'endofline'`  `'eol'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	When writing a file and this option is off and the `'binary'`  option
 	is on, or `'fixeol'`  option is off, no <EOL> will be written for the
 	last line in the file.  This option is automatically set or reset when
 	starting to edit a new file, depending on whether file has an <EOL>
 	for the last line in the file.  Normally you don't have to set or
 	reset this option.
 	When `'binary'`  is off and `'fixeol'`  is on the value is not used when
 	writing the file.  When `'binary'`  is on or `'fixeol'`  is off it is used
 	to remember the presence of a <EOL> for the last line in the file, so
 	that when you write the file the situation from the original file can
 	be kept.  But you can change it if you want to.
 	See |eol-and-eof| for example settings.

## eof


```lua
boolean
```

## eol


```lua
boolean
```

## ep


```lua
string
```

## equalprg


```lua
string
```

 `'equalprg'`  `'ep'` 		string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	External program to use for "=" command.  When this option is empty
 	the internal formatting functions are used; either `'lisp'` , `'cindent'` 
 	or `'indentexpr'` .
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
 	about including spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## errorformat


```lua
string
```

 `'errorformat'`  `'efm'` 	string	(default is very long)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Scanf-like description of the format for the lines in the error file
 	(see |errorformat|).

## et


```lua
boolean
```

## expandtab


```lua
boolean
```

 `'expandtab'`  `'et'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	In Insert mode: Use the appropriate number of spaces to insert a
 	<Tab>.  Spaces are used in indents with the `'>'`  and `'<'`  commands and
 	when `'autoindent'`  is on.  To insert a real tab when `'expandtab'`  is
 	on, use CTRL-V<Tab>.  See also |:retab| and |ins-expandtab|.

## fenc


```lua
string
```

## fex


```lua
string
```

## ff


```lua
string
```

## fileencoding


```lua
string
```

 `'fileencoding'`  `'fenc'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	File-content encoding for the current buffer. Conversion is done with
 	iconv() or as specified with `'charconvert'` .
 
 	When `'fileencoding'`  is not UTF-8, conversion will be done when
 	writing the file.  For reading see below.
 	When `'fileencoding'`  is empty, the file will be saved with UTF-8
 	encoding (no conversion when reading or writing a file).
 
 	WARNING: Conversion to a non-Unicode encoding can cause loss of
 	information!
 
 	See |encoding-names| for the possible values.  Additionally, values may be
 	specified that can be handled by the converter, see
 	|mbyte-conversion|.
 
 	When reading a file `'fileencoding'`  will be set from `'fileencodings'` .
 	To read a file in a certain encoding it won't work by setting
 	`'fileencoding'` , use the |++enc| argument.  One exception: when
 	`'fileencodings'`  is empty the value of `'fileencoding'`  is used.
 	For a new file the global value of `'fileencoding'`  is used.
 
 	Prepending "8bit-" and "2byte-" has no meaning here, they are ignored.
 	When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
 	you can set it with uppercase values too.  `'_'`  characters are
 	replaced with `'-'` .  If a name is recognized from the list at
 	|encoding-names|, it is replaced by the standard name.  For example
 	"ISO8859-2" becomes "iso-8859-2".
 
 	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the `'modified'` 
 	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
 
 	Keep in mind that changing `'fenc'`  from a modeline happens
 	AFTER the text has been read, thus it applies to when the file will be
 	written.  If you do set `'fenc'`  in a modeline, you might want to set
 	`'nomodified'`  to avoid not being able to ":q".
 
 	This option cannot be changed when `'modifiable'`  is off.

## fileformat


```lua
string
```

 `'fileformat'`  `'ff'` 	string (Windows default: "dos",
 				Unix default: "unix")
 			local to buffer
 	This gives the <EOL> of the current buffer, which is used for
 	reading/writing the buffer from/to a file:
 	    dos	    <CR><NL>
 	    unix    <NL>
 	    mac	    <CR>
 	When "dos" is used, CTRL-Z at the end of a file is ignored.
 	See |file-formats| and |file-read|.
 	For the character encoding of the file see `'fileencoding'` .
 	When `'binary'`  is set, the value of `'fileformat'`  is ignored, file I/O
 	works like it was set to "unix".
 	This option is set automatically when starting to edit a file and
 	`'fileformats'`  is not empty and `'binary'`  is off.
 	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the `'modified'` 
 	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
 	This option cannot be changed when `'modifiable'`  is off.

## filetype


```lua
string
```

 `'filetype'`  `'ft'` 		string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	When this option is set, the FileType autocommand event is triggered.
 	All autocommands that match with the value of this option will be
 	executed.  Thus the value of `'filetype'`  is used in place of the file
 	name.
 	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current file type.
 	This option is normally set when the file type is detected.  To enable
 	this use the ":filetype on" command. |:filetype|
 	Setting this option to a different value is most useful in a modeline,
 	for a file for which the file type is not automatically recognized.
 	Example, for in an IDL file: >
 		/* vim: set filetype=idl : */
 <	|FileType| |filetypes|
 	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
 	names.  Example: >
 		/* vim: set filetype=c.doxygen : */
 <	This will use the "c" filetype first, then the "doxygen" filetype.
 	This works both for filetype plugins and for syntax files.  More than
 	one dot may appear.
 	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the `'s'`  or
 	`'S'`  flag in `'cpoptions'` .
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

## fixendofline


```lua
boolean
```

 `'fixendofline'`  `'fixeol'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	When writing a file and this option is on, <EOL> at the end of file
 	will be restored if missing.  Turn this option off if you want to
 	preserve the situation from the original file.
 	When the `'binary'`  option is set the value of this option doesn't
 	matter.
 	See the `'endofline'`  option.
 	See |eol-and-eof| for example settings.

## fixeol


```lua
boolean
```

## flp


```lua
string
```

## fo


```lua
string
```

## formatexpr


```lua
string
```

 `'formatexpr'`  `'fex'` 	string (default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression which is evaluated to format a range of lines for the |gq|
 	operator or automatic formatting (see `'formatoptions'` ).  When this
 	option is empty `'formatprg'`  is used.
 
 	The |v:lnum|  variable holds the first line to be formatted.
 	The |v:count| variable holds the number of lines to be formatted.
 	The |v:char|  variable holds the character that is going to be
 		      inserted if the expression is being evaluated due to
 		      automatic formatting.  This can be empty.  Don't insert
 		      it yet!
 
 	Example: >
 		:set formatexpr=mylang#Format()
 <	This will invoke the mylang#Format() function in the
 	autoload/mylang.vim file in `'runtimepath'` . |autoload|
 
 	The expression is also evaluated when `'textwidth'`  is set and adding
 	text beyond that limit.  This happens under the same conditions as
 	when internal formatting is used.  Make sure the cursor is kept in the
 	same spot relative to the text then!  The |mode()| function will
 	return "i" or "R" in this situation.
 
 	When the expression evaluates to non-zero Vim will fall back to using
 	the internal format mechanism.
 
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set formatexpr=s:MyFormatExpr()
 		set formatexpr=<SID>SomeFormatExpr()
 <
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.  That stops the option from working,
 	since changing the buffer text is not allowed.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 	NOTE: This option is set to "" when `'compatible'`  is set.

## formatlistpat


```lua
string
```

 `'formatlistpat'`  `'flp'` 	string (default: "^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*")
 			local to buffer
 	A pattern that is used to recognize a list header.  This is used for
 	the "n" flag in `'formatoptions'` .
 	The pattern must match exactly the text that will be the indent for
 	the line below it.  You can use |/\ze| to mark the end of the match
 	while still checking more characters.  There must be a character
 	following the pattern, when it matches the whole line it is handled
 	like there is no match.
 	The default recognizes a number, followed by an optional punctuation
 	character and white space.

## formatoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'formatoptions'`  `'fo'` 	string (default: "tcqj")
 			local to buffer
 	This is a sequence of letters which describes how automatic
 	formatting is to be done.  See |fo-table|.  Commas can be inserted for
 	readability.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

## formatprg


```lua
string
```

 `'formatprg'`  `'fp'` 	string (default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	The name of an external program that will be used to format the lines
 	selected with the |gq| operator.  The program must take the input on
 	stdin and produce the output on stdout.  The Unix program "fmt" is
 	such a program.
 	If the `'formatexpr'`  option is not empty it will be used instead.
 	Otherwise, if `'formatprg'`  option is an empty string, the internal
 	format function will be used |C-indenting|.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
 	about including spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## fp


```lua
string
```

## ft


```lua
string
```

## gp


```lua
string
```

## grepprg


```lua
string
```

 `'grepprg'`  `'gp'` 		string	(default "grep -n ",
 				 Unix: "grep -n $* /dev/null")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Program to use for the |:grep| command.  This option may contain `'%'` 
 	and `'#'`  characters, which are expanded like when used in a command-
 	line.  The placeholder "$*" is allowed to specify where the arguments
 	will be included.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See
 	|option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	When your "grep" accepts the "-H" argument, use this to make ":grep"
 	also work well with a single file: >
 		:set grepprg=grep\ -nH
 <	Special value: When `'grepprg'`  is set to "internal" the |:grep| command
 	works like |:vimgrep|, |:lgrep| like |:lvimgrep|, |:grepadd| like
 	|:vimgrepadd| and |:lgrepadd| like |:lvimgrepadd|.
 	See also the section |:make_makeprg|, since most of the comments there
 	apply equally to `'grepprg'` .
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## imi


```lua
integer
```

## iminsert


```lua
integer
```

 `'iminsert'`  `'imi'` 	number (default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Specifies whether :lmap or an Input Method (IM) is to be used in
 	Insert mode.  Valid values:
 		0	:lmap is off and IM is off
 		1	:lmap is ON and IM is off
 		2	:lmap is off and IM is ON
 	To always reset the option to zero when leaving Insert mode with <Esc>
 	this can be used: >
 		:inoremap <ESC> <ESC>:set iminsert=0<CR>
 <	This makes :lmap and IM turn off automatically when leaving Insert
 	mode.
 	Note that this option changes when using CTRL-^ in Insert mode
 	|i_CTRL-^|.
 	The value is set to 1 when setting `'keymap'`  to a valid keymap name.
 	It is also used for the argument of commands like "r" and "f".

## ims


```lua
integer
```

## imsearch


```lua
integer
```

 `'imsearch'`  `'ims'` 	number (default -1)
 			local to buffer
 	Specifies whether :lmap or an Input Method (IM) is to be used when
 	entering a search pattern.  Valid values:
 		-1	the value of `'iminsert'`  is used, makes it look like
 			`'iminsert'`  is also used when typing a search pattern
 		0	:lmap is off and IM is off
 		1	:lmap is ON and IM is off
 		2	:lmap is off and IM is ON
 	Note that this option changes when using CTRL-^ in Command-line mode
 	|c_CTRL-^|.
 	The value is set to 1 when it is not -1 and setting the `'keymap'` 
 	option to a valid keymap name.

## inc


```lua
string
```

## include


```lua
string
```

 `'include'`  `'inc'` 		string	(default "^\sinclude")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Pattern to be used to find an include command.  It is a search
 	pattern, just like for the "/" command (See |pattern|).  The default
 	value is for C programs.  This option is used for the commands "[i",
 	"]I", "[d", etc.
 	Normally the `'isfname'`  option is used to recognize the file name that
 	comes after the matched pattern.  But if "\zs" appears in the pattern
 	then the text matched from "\zs" to the end, or until "\ze" if it
 	appears, is used as the file name.  Use this to include characters
 	that are not in `'isfname'` , such as a space.  You can then use
 	`'includeexpr'`  to process the matched text.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

## includeexpr


```lua
string
```

 `'includeexpr'`  `'inex'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression to be used to transform the string found with the `'include'` 
 	option to a file name.  Mostly useful to change "." to "/" for Java: >
 		:setlocal includeexpr=substitute(v:fname,`'\\.'` ,`'/'` ,`'g'` )
 <	The "v:fname" variable will be set to the file name that was detected.
 	Note the double backslash: the `:set` command first halves them, then
 	one remains in the value, where "\." matches a dot literally.  For
 	simple character replacements `tr()` avoids the need for escaping: >
 		:setlocal includeexpr=tr(v:fname,`'.'` ,`'/'` )
 <
 	Also used for the |gf| command if an unmodified file name can't be
 	found.  Allows doing "gf" on the name after an `'include'`  statement.
 	Also used for |<cfile>|.
 
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set includeexpr=s:MyIncludeExpr(v:fname)
 		set includeexpr=<SID>SomeIncludeExpr(v:fname)
 <
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'includeexpr'`  |textlock|.

## inde


```lua
string
```

## indentexpr


```lua
string
```

 `'indentexpr'`  `'inde'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression which is evaluated to obtain the proper indent for a line.
 	It is used when a new line is created, for the |=| operator and
 	in Insert mode as specified with the `'indentkeys'`  option.
 	When this option is not empty, it overrules the `'cindent'`  and
 	`'smartindent'`  indenting.  When `'lisp'`  is set, this option is
 	is only used when `'lispoptions'`  contains "expr:1".
 	The expression is evaluated with |v:lnum| set to the line number for
 	which the indent is to be computed.  The cursor is also in this line
 	when the expression is evaluated (but it may be moved around).
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set indentexpr=s:MyIndentExpr()
 		set indentexpr=<SID>SomeIndentExpr()
 <
 	The expression must return the number of spaces worth of indent.  It
 	can return "-1" to keep the current indent (this means `'autoindent'`  is
 	used for the indent).
 	Functions useful for computing the indent are |indent()|, |cindent()|
 	and |lispindent()|.
 	The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!  It must
 	not change the text, jump to another window, etc.  Afterwards the
 	cursor position is always restored, thus the cursor may be moved.
 	Normally this option would be set to call a function: >
 		:set indentexpr=GetMyIndent()
 <	Error messages will be suppressed, unless the `'debug'`  option contains
 	"msg".
 	See |indent-expression|.
 
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'indentexpr'`  |textlock|.

## indentkeys


```lua
string
```

 `'indentkeys'`  `'indk'` 	string	(default "0{,0},0),0],:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
 			local to buffer
 	A list of keys that, when typed in Insert mode, cause reindenting of
 	the current line.  Only happens if `'indentexpr'`  isn't empty.
 	The format is identical to `'cinkeys'` , see |indentkeys-format|.
 	See |C-indenting| and |indent-expression|.

## indk


```lua
string
```

## inex


```lua
string
```

## inf


```lua
boolean
```

## infercase


```lua
boolean
```

 `'infercase'`  `'inf'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When doing keyword completion in insert mode |ins-completion|, and
 	`'ignorecase'`  is also on, the case of the match is adjusted depending
 	on the typed text.  If the typed text contains a lowercase letter
 	where the match has an upper case letter, the completed part is made
 	lowercase.  If the typed text has no lowercase letters and the match
 	has a lowercase letter where the typed text has an uppercase letter,
 	and there is a letter before it, the completed part is made uppercase.
 	With `'noinfercase'`  the match is used as-is.

## isk


```lua
string
```

## iskeyword


```lua
string
```

 `'iskeyword'`  `'isk'` 	string (default: @,48-57,_,192-255)
 			local to buffer
 	Keywords are used in searching and recognizing with many commands:
 	"w", "*", "[i", etc.  It is also used for "\k" in a |pattern|.  See
 	`'isfname'`  for a description of the format of this option.  For `'@'` 
 	characters above 255 check the "word" character class (any character
 	that is not white space or punctuation).
 	For C programs you could use "a-z,A-Z,48-57,_,.,-,>".
 	For a help file it is set to all non-blank printable characters except
 	`'*'` , `'"'`  and `'|'`  (so that CTRL-] on a command finds the help for that
 	command).
 	When the `'lisp'`  option is on the `'-'`  character is always included.
 	This option also influences syntax highlighting, unless the syntax
 	uses |:syn-iskeyword|.

## keymap


```lua
string
```

 `'keymap'`  `'kmp'` 		string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Name of a keyboard mapping.  See |mbyte-keymap|.
 	Setting this option to a valid keymap name has the side effect of
 	setting `'iminsert'`  to one, so that the keymap becomes effective.
 	`'imsearch'`  is also set to one, unless it was -1
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

## keywordprg


```lua
string
```

 `'keywordprg'`  `'kp'` 	string	(default ":Man", Windows: ":help")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Program to use for the |K| command.  Environment variables are
 	expanded |:set_env|.  ":help" may be used to access the Vim internal
 	help.  (Note that previously setting the global option to the empty
 	value did this, which is now deprecated.)
 	When the first character is ":", the command is invoked as a Vim
 	Ex command prefixed with [count].
 	When "man" or "man -s" is used, Vim will automatically translate
 	a [count] for the "K" command to a section number.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	Example: >
 		:set keywordprg=man\ -s
 		:set keywordprg=:Man
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## kmp


```lua
string
```

## kp


```lua
string
```

## lisp


```lua
boolean
```

 `'lisp'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Lisp mode: When <Enter> is typed in insert mode set the indent for
 	the next line to Lisp standards (well, sort of).  Also happens with
 	"cc" or "S".  `'autoindent'`  must also be on for this to work.  The `'p'` 
 	flag in `'cpoptions'`  changes the method of indenting: Vi compatible or
 	better.  Also see `'lispwords'` .
 	The `'-'`  character is included in keyword characters.  Redefines the
 	"=" operator to use this same indentation algorithm rather than
 	calling an external program if `'equalprg'`  is empty.

## lispoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'lispoptions'`  `'lop'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Comma-separated list of items that influence the Lisp indenting when
 	enabled with the |`'lisp'` | option.  Currently only one item is
 	supported:
 		expr:1	use `'indentexpr'`  for Lisp indenting when it is set
 		expr:0	do not use `'indentexpr'`  for Lisp indenting (default)
 	Note that when using `'indentexpr'`  the `=` operator indents all the
 	lines, otherwise the first line is not indented (Vi-compatible).

## lispwords


```lua
string
```

 `'lispwords'`  `'lw'` 	string	(default is very long)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Comma-separated list of words that influence the Lisp indenting when
 	enabled with the |`'lisp'` | option.

## lop


```lua
string
```

## lw


```lua
string
```

## ma


```lua
boolean
```

## makeencoding


```lua
string
```

 `'makeencoding'`  `'menc'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Encoding used for reading the output of external commands.  When empty,
 	encoding is not converted.
 	This is used for `:make`, `:lmake`, `:grep`, `:lgrep`, `:grepadd`,
 	`:lgrepadd`, `:cfile`, `:cgetfile`, `:caddfile`, `:lfile`, `:lgetfile`,
 	and `:laddfile`.
 
 	This would be mostly useful when you use MS-Windows.  If iconv is
 	enabled, setting `'makeencoding'`  to "char" has the same effect as
 	setting to the system locale encoding.  Example: >
 		:set makeencoding=char	" system locale is used
 <

## makeprg


```lua
string
```

 `'makeprg'`  `'mp'` 		string	(default "make")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Program to use for the ":make" command.  See |:make_makeprg|.
 	This option may contain `'%'`  and `'#'`  characters (see  |:_%| and |:_#|),
 	which are expanded to the current and alternate file name.  Use |::S|
 	to escape file names in case they contain special characters.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
 	about including spaces and backslashes.
 	Note that a `'|'`  must be escaped twice: once for ":set" and once for
 	the interpretation of a command.  When you use a filter called
 	"myfilter" do it like this: >
 	    :set makeprg=gmake\ \\\|\ myfilter
 <	The placeholder "$*" can be given (even multiple times) to specify
 	where the arguments will be included, for example: >
 	    :set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## matchpairs


```lua
string
```

 `'matchpairs'`  `'mps'` 	string	(default "(:),{:},[:]")
 			local to buffer
 	Characters that form pairs.  The |%| command jumps from one to the
 	other.
 	Only character pairs are allowed that are different, thus you cannot
 	jump between two double quotes.
 	The characters must be separated by a colon.
 	The pairs must be separated by a comma.  Example for including `'<'`  and
 	`'>'`  (for HTML): >
 		:set mps+=<:>
 
 <	A more exotic example, to jump between the `'='`  and `';'`  in an
 	assignment, useful for languages like C and Java: >
 		:au FileType c,cpp,java set mps+==:;
 
 <	For a more advanced way of using "%", see the matchit.vim plugin in
 	the $VIMRUNTIME/plugin directory. |add-local-help|

## menc


```lua
string
```

## ml


```lua
boolean
```

## mod


```lua
boolean
```

## modeline


```lua
boolean
```

 `'modeline'`  `'ml'` 		boolean	(default: on (off for root))
 			local to buffer
 	If `'modeline'`  is on `'modelines'`  gives the number of lines that is
 	checked for set commands.  If `'modeline'`  is off or `'modelines'`  is zero
 	no lines are checked.  See |modeline|.

## modifiable


```lua
boolean
```

 `'modifiable'`  `'ma'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	When off the buffer contents cannot be changed.  The `'fileformat'`  and
 	`'fileencoding'`  options also can't be changed.
 	Can be reset on startup with the |-M| command line argument.

## modified


```lua
boolean
```

 `'modified'`  `'mod'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When on, the buffer is considered to be modified.  This option is set
 	when:
 	1. A change was made to the text since it was last written.  Using the
 	   |undo| command to go back to the original text will reset the
 	   option.  But undoing changes that were made before writing the
 	   buffer will set the option again, since the text is different from
 	   when it was written.
 	2. `'fileformat'`  or `'fileencoding'`  is different from its original
 	   value.  The original value is set when the buffer is read or
 	   written.  A ":set nomodified" command also resets the original
 	   values to the current values and the `'modified'`  option will be
 	   reset.
 	   Similarly for `'eol'`  and `'bomb'` .
 	This option is not set when a change is made to the buffer as the
 	result of a BufNewFile, BufRead/BufReadPost, BufWritePost,
 	FileAppendPost or VimLeave autocommand event.  See |gzip-example| for
 	an explanation.
 	When `'buftype'`  is "nowrite" or "nofile" this option may be set, but
 	will be ignored.
 	Note that the text may actually be the same, e.g. `'modified'`  is set
 	when using "rA" on an "A".

## mp


```lua
string
```

## mps


```lua
string
```

## nf


```lua
string
```

## nrformats


```lua
string
```

 `'nrformats'`  `'nf'` 	string	(default "bin,hex")
 			local to buffer
 	This defines what bases Vim will consider for numbers when using the
 	CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands for adding to and subtracting from a number
 	respectively; see |CTRL-A| for more info on these commands.
 	alpha	If included, single alphabetical characters will be
 		incremented or decremented.  This is useful for a list with a
 		letter index a), b), etc.
 	octal	If included, numbers that start with a zero will be considered
 		to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in "010".
 	hex	If included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
 		considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
 		"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
 	bin	If included, numbers starting with "0b" or "0B" will be
 		considered to be binary.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
 		"0b1000" subtracts one, resulting in "0b0111".
 	unsigned    If included, numbers are recognized as unsigned. Thus a
 		leading dash or negative sign won't be considered as part of
 		the number.  Examples:
 		    Using CTRL-X on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2019"
 		    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2021").
 		    Using CTRL-A on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2021"
 		    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2019").
 		    Using CTRL-X on "0" or CTRL-A on "18446744073709551615"
 		    (2^64 - 1) has no effect, overflow is prevented.
 	Numbers which simply begin with a digit in the range 1-9 are always
 	considered decimal.  This also happens for numbers that are not
 	recognized as octal or hex.

## ofu


```lua
string
```

## omnifunc


```lua
string
```

 `'omnifunc'`  `'ofu'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode omni
 	completion with CTRL-X CTRL-O. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|
 	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
 	invoked and what it should return.  The value can be the name of a
 	function, a |lambda| or a |Funcref|. See |option-value-function| for
 	more information.
 	This option is usually set by a filetype plugin:
 	|:filetype-plugin-on|
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## pa


```lua
string
```

## path


```lua
string
```

 `'path'`  `'pa'` 		string	(default on Unix: ".,/usr/include,,"
 				   other systems: ".,,")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
 	|gf|, [f, ]f, ^Wf, |:find|, |:sfind|, |:tabfind| and other commands,
 	provided that the file being searched for has a relative path (not
 	starting with "/", "./" or "../").  The directories in the `'path'` 
 	option may be relative or absolute.
 	- Use commas to separate directory names: >
 		:set path=.,/usr/local/include,/usr/include
 <	- Spaces can also be used to separate directory names (for backwards
 	  compatibility with version 3.0).  To have a space in a directory
 	  name, precede it with an extra backslash, and escape the space: >
 		:set path=.,/dir/with\\\ space
 <	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with an extra
 	  backslash: >
 		:set path=.,/dir/with\\,comma
 <	- To search relative to the directory of the current file, use: >
 		:set path=.
 <	- To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
 	  commas: >
 		:set path=,,
 <	- A directory name may end in a `':'`  or `'/'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- When using |netrw.vim| URLs can be used.  For example, adding
 	  "https://www.vim.org" will make ":find index.html" work.
 	- Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "" and
 	  ";".  See |file-searching| for info and syntax.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type two to get one in the option: >
 		:set path=.,c:\\include
 <	  Or just use `'/'`  instead: >
 		:set path=.,c:/include
 <	Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
 	the file!
 	The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
 	it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
 	You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
 	`'path'` , see |:checkpath|.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.  To remove the current directory use: >
 		:set path-=
 <	To add the current directory use: >
 		:set path+=
 <	To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the
 	separator.  Here is an example to append $INCL, in which directory
 	names are separated with a semi-colon: >
 		:let &path = &path .. "," .. substitute($INCL, `';'` , `','` , `'g'` )
 <	Replace the `';'`  with a `':'`  or whatever separator is used.  Note that
 	this doesn't work when $INCL contains a comma or white space.

## pi


```lua
boolean
```

## preserveindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'preserveindent'`  `'pi'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When changing the indent of the current line, preserve as much of the
 	indent structure as possible.  Normally the indent is replaced by a
 	series of tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |`'expandtab'` | is
 	enabled, in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option
 	means the indent will preserve as many existing characters as possible
 	for indenting, and only add additional tabs or spaces as required.
 	`'expandtab'`  does not apply to the preserved white space, a Tab remains
 	a Tab.
 	NOTE: When using ">>" multiple times the resulting indent is a mix of
 	tabs and spaces.  You might not like this.
 	Also see `'copyindent'` .
 	Use |:retab| to clean up white space.

## qe


```lua
string
```

## quoteescape


```lua
string
```

 `'quoteescape'`  `'qe'` 	string	(default "\")
 			local to buffer
 	The characters that are used to escape quotes in a string.  Used for
 	objects like a', a" and a` |a'|.
 	When one of the characters in this option is found inside a string,
 	the following character will be skipped.  The default value makes the
 	text "foo\"bar\\" considered to be one string.

## readonly


```lua
boolean
```

 `'readonly'`  `'ro'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	If on, writes fail unless you use a `'!'` .  Protects you from
 	accidentally overwriting a file.  Default on when Vim is started
 	in read-only mode ("vim -R") or when the executable is called "view".
 	When using ":w!" the `'readonly'`  option is reset for the current
 	buffer, unless the `'Z'`  flag is in `'cpoptions'` .
 	When using the ":view" command the `'readonly'`  option is set for the
 	newly edited buffer.
 	See `'modifiable'`  for disallowing changes to the buffer.

## ro


```lua
boolean
```

## scbk


```lua
integer
```

## scrollback


```lua
integer
```

 `'scrollback'`  `'scbk'` 	number	(default: 10000)
 			local to buffer
 	Maximum number of lines kept beyond the visible screen. Lines at the
 	top are deleted if new lines exceed this limit.
 	Minimum is 1, maximum is 100000.
 	Only in |terminal| buffers.

## shiftwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'shiftwidth'`  `'sw'` 	number	(default 8)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent.  Used for
 	|`'cindent'` |, |>>|, |<<|, etc.
 	When zero the `'ts'`  value will be used.  Use the |shiftwidth()|
 	function to get the effective shiftwidth value.

## si


```lua
boolean
```

## smartindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'smartindent'`  `'si'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Do smart autoindenting when starting a new line.  Works for C-like
 	programs, but can also be used for other languages.  `'cindent'`  does
 	something like this, works better in most cases, but is more strict,
 	see |C-indenting|.  When `'cindent'`  is on or `'indentexpr'`  is set,
 	setting `'si'`  has no effect.  `'indentexpr'`  is a more advanced
 	alternative.
 	Normally `'autoindent'`  should also be on when using `'smartindent'` .
 	An indent is automatically inserted:
 	- After a line ending in "{".
 	- After a line starting with a keyword from `'cinwords'` .
 	- Before a line starting with "}" (only with the "O" command).
 	When typing `'}'`  as the first character in a new line, that line is
 	given the same indent as the matching "{".
 	When typing `'#'`  as the first character in a new line, the indent for
 	that line is removed, the `'#'`  is put in the first column.  The indent
 	is restored for the next line.  If you don't want this, use this
 	mapping: ":inoremap # X^H#", where ^H is entered with CTRL-V CTRL-H.
 	When using the ">>" command, lines starting with `'#'`  are not shifted
 	right.

## smc


```lua
integer
```

## softtabstop


```lua
integer
```

 `'softtabstop'`  `'sts'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while performing editing
 	operations, like inserting a <Tab> or using <BS>.  It "feels" like
 	<Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mix of spaces and <Tab>s is
 	used.  This is useful to keep the `'ts'`  setting at its standard value
 	of 8, while being able to edit like it is set to `'sts'` .  However,
 	commands like "x" still work on the actual characters.
 	When `'sts'`  is zero, this feature is off.
 	When `'sts'`  is negative, the value of `'shiftwidth'`  is used.
 	See also |ins-expandtab|.  When `'expandtab'`  is not set, the number of
 	spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
 	The `'L'`  flag in `'cpoptions'`  changes how tabs are used when `'list'`  is
 	set.
 
 	The value of `'softtabstop'`  will be ignored if |`'varsofttabstop'` | is set
 	to anything other than an empty string.

## spc


```lua
string
```

## spellcapcheck


```lua
string
```

 `'spellcapcheck'`  `'spc'` 	string	(default "[.?!]\_[\])'" \t]\+")
 			local to buffer
 	Pattern to locate the end of a sentence.  The following word will be
 	checked to start with a capital letter.  If not then it is highlighted
 	with SpellCap |hl-SpellCap| (unless the word is also badly spelled).
 	When this check is not wanted make this option empty.
 	Only used when `'spell'`  is set.
 	Be careful with special characters, see |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes.
 	To set this option automatically depending on the language, see
 	|set-spc-auto|.

## spellfile


```lua
string
```

 `'spellfile'`  `'spf'` 	string	(default empty)
 			local to buffer
 	Name of the word list file where words are added for the |zg| and |zw|
 	commands.  It must end in ".{encoding}.add".  You need to include the
 	path, otherwise the file is placed in the current directory.
 
 	It may also be a comma-separated list of names.  A count before the
 	|zg| and |zw| commands can be used to access each.  This allows using
 	a personal word list file and a project word list file.
 	When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
 	you: Using the first directory in `'runtimepath'`  that is writable.  If
 	there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
 	name the first language name that appears in `'spelllang'`  is used,
 	ignoring the region.
 	The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
 	have to appear in `'spelllang'` .
 	Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
 	name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
 	`'spellfile'`  is set to it, for entries in `'spelllang'`  only files
 	without region name will be found.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## spelllang


```lua
string
```

 `'spelllang'`  `'spl'` 	string	(default "en")
 			local to buffer
 	A comma-separated list of word list names.  When the `'spell'`  option is
 	on spellchecking will be done for these languages.  Example: >
 		set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical
 <	This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
 	that are not recognized will be highlighted.
 	The word list name must consist of alphanumeric characters, a dash or
 	an underscore.  It should not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
 	recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
 	specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
 	A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
 	the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
 	region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
 	English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
 	Britain. (Note: currently en_au and en_nz dictionaries are older than
 	en_ca, en_gb and en_us).
 	If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
 	spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
 	words.
 	Note that the "medical" dictionary does not exist, it is just an
 	example of a longer name.
 
 	As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
 	first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
 	(_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
 	This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
 	encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
 	How the related spell files are found is explained here: |spell-load|.
 
 	If the |spellfile.vim| plugin is active and you use a language name
 	for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in `'runtimepath'`  the plugin
 	will ask you if you want to download the file.
 
 	After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
 	"spell/LANG.vim" in `'runtimepath'` .  "LANG" is the value of `'spelllang'` 
 	up to the first character that is not an ASCII letter or number and
 	not a dash.  Also see |set-spc-auto|.

## spelloptions


```lua
string
```

 `'spelloptions'`  `'spo'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	A comma-separated list of options for spell checking:
 	camel		When a word is CamelCased, assume "Cased" is a
 			separate word: every upper-case character in a word
 			that comes after a lower case character indicates the
 			start of a new word.
 	noplainbuffer	Only spellcheck a buffer when `'syntax'`  is enabled,
 			or when extmarks are set within the buffer. Only
 			designated regions of the buffer are spellchecked in
 			this case.

## spf


```lua
string
```

## spl


```lua
string
```

## spo


```lua
string
```

## sts


```lua
integer
```

## sua


```lua
string
```

## suffixesadd


```lua
string
```

 `'suffixesadd'`  `'sua'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Comma-separated list of suffixes, which are used when searching for a
 	file for the "gf", "[I", etc. commands.  Example: >
 		:set suffixesadd=.java
 <

## sw


```lua
integer
```

## swapfile


```lua
boolean
```

 `'swapfile'`  `'swf'` 	boolean (default on)
 			local to buffer
 	Use a swapfile for the buffer.  This option can be reset when a
 	swapfile is not wanted for a specific buffer.  For example, with
 	confidential information that even root must not be able to access.
 	Careful: All text will be in memory:
 		- Don't use this for big files.
 		- Recovery will be impossible!
 	A swapfile will only be present when |`'updatecount'` | is non-zero and
 	`'swapfile'`  is set.
 	When `'swapfile'`  is reset, the swap file for the current buffer is
 	immediately deleted.  When `'swapfile'`  is set, and `'updatecount'`  is
 	non-zero, a swap file is immediately created.
 	Also see |swap-file|.
 	If you want to open a new buffer without creating a swap file for it,
 	use the |:noswapfile| modifier.
 	See `'directory'`  for where the swap file is created.
 
 	This option is used together with `'bufhidden'`  and `'buftype'`  to
 	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

## swf


```lua
boolean
```

## syn


```lua
string
```

## synmaxcol


```lua
integer
```

 `'synmaxcol'`  `'smc'` 	number	(default 3000)
 			local to buffer
 	Maximum column in which to search for syntax items.  In long lines the
 	text after this column is not highlighted and following lines may not
 	be highlighted correctly, because the syntax state is cleared.
 	This helps to avoid very slow redrawing for an XML file that is one
 	long line.
 	Set to zero to remove the limit.

## syntax


```lua
string
```

 `'syntax'`  `'syn'` 		string	(default empty)
 			local to buffer
 	When this option is set, the syntax with this name is loaded, unless
 	syntax highlighting has been switched off with ":syntax off".
 	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current syntax (the
 	b:current_syntax variable does).
 	This option is most useful in a modeline, for a file which syntax is
 	not automatically recognized.  Example, in an IDL file: >
 		/* vim: set syntax=idl : */
 <	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
 	names.  Example: >
 		/* vim: set syntax=c.doxygen : */
 <	This will use the "c" syntax first, then the "doxygen" syntax.
 	Note that the second one must be prepared to be loaded as an addition,
 	otherwise it will be skipped.  More than one dot may appear.
 	To switch off syntax highlighting for the current file, use: >
 		:set syntax=OFF
 <	To switch syntax highlighting on according to the current value of the
 	`'filetype'`  option: >
 		:set syntax=ON
 <	What actually happens when setting the `'syntax'`  option is that the
 	Syntax autocommand event is triggered with the value as argument.
 	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the `'s'`  or
 	`'S'`  flag in `'cpoptions'` .
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

## tabstop


```lua
integer
```

 `'tabstop'`  `'ts'` 		number	(default 8)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
 	the |:retab| command, and the `'softtabstop'`  option.
 
 	Note: Setting `'tabstop'`  to any other value than 8 can make your file
 	appear wrong in many places.
 	The value must be more than 0 and less than 10000.
 
 	There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
 	1. Always keep `'tabstop'`  at 8, set `'softtabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to 4
 	   (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use `'noexpandtab'` .  Then Vim
 	   will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
 	   behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
 	2. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use
 	   `'expandtab'` .  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
 	   formatting will never be messed up when `'tabstop'`  is changed.
 	3. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use a
 	   |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
 	   works when using Vim to edit the file.
 	4. Always set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to the same value, and
 	   `'noexpandtab'` .  This should then work (for initial indents only)
 	   for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
 	   tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
 	   though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when `'tabstop'`  is
 	   changed.
 
 	The value of `'tabstop'`  will be ignored if |`'vartabstop'` | is set to
 	anything other than an empty string.

## tag


```lua
string
```

## tagcase


```lua
string
```

 `'tagcase'`  `'tc'` 		string	(default "followic")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	This option specifies how case is handled when searching the tags
 	file:
 	   followic	Follow the `'ignorecase'`  option
 	   followscs    Follow the `'smartcase'`  and `'ignorecase'`  options
 	   ignore	Ignore case
 	   match	Match case
 	   smart	Ignore case unless an upper case letter is used

## tagfunc


```lua
string
```

 `'tagfunc'`  `'tfu'` 		string	(default: empty)
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies a function to be used to perform tag searches.
 	The function gets the tag pattern and should return a List of matching
 	tags.  See |tag-function| for an explanation of how to write the
 	function and an example.  The value can be the name of a function, a
 	|lambda| or a |Funcref|. See |option-value-function| for more
 	information.

## tags


```lua
string
```

 `'tags'`  `'tag'` 		string	(default "./tags;,tags")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Filenames for the tag command, separated by spaces or commas.  To
 	include a space or comma in a file name, precede it with a backslash
 	(see |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes).
 	When a file name starts with "./", the `'.'`  is replaced with the path
 	of the current file.  But only when the `'d'`  flag is not included in
 	`'cpoptions'` .  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  Also see
 	|tags-option|.
 	"*", "" and other wildcards can be used to search for tags files in
 	a directory tree.  See |file-searching|.  E.g., "/lib//tags" will
 	find all files named "tags" below "/lib".  The filename itself cannot
 	contain wildcards, it is used as-is.  E.g., "/lib//tags?" will find
 	files called "tags?".
 	The |tagfiles()| function can be used to get a list of the file names
 	actually used.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	file names from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.

## tc


```lua
string
```

## textwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'textwidth'`  `'tw'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Maximum width of text that is being inserted.  A longer line will be
 	broken after white space to get this width.  A zero value disables
 	this.
 	When `'textwidth'`  is zero, `'wrapmargin'`  may be used.  See also
 	`'formatoptions'`  and |ins-textwidth|.
 	When `'formatexpr'`  is set it will be used to break the line.

## tfu


```lua
string
```

## thesaurus


```lua
string
```

 `'thesaurus'`  `'tsr'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
 	for thesaurus completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.  See
 	|compl-thesaurus|.
 
 	This option is not used if `'thesaurusfunc'`  is set, either for the
 	buffer or globally.
 
 	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
 	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
 	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.  The use of
 	|:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing directories
 	from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version uses
 	another default.  Backticks cannot be used in this option for security
 	reasons.

## thesaurusfunc


```lua
string
```

 `'thesaurusfunc'`  `'tsrfu'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	This option specifies a function to be used for thesaurus completion
 	with CTRL-X CTRL-T. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T| See |compl-thesaurusfunc|.
 	The value can be the name of a function, a |lambda| or a |Funcref|.
 	See |option-value-function| for more information.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## ts


```lua
integer
```

## tsr


```lua
string
```

## tsrfu


```lua
string
```

## tw


```lua
integer
```

## udf


```lua
boolean
```

## ul


```lua
integer
```

## undofile


```lua
boolean
```

 `'undofile'`  `'udf'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When on, Vim automatically saves undo history to an undo file when
 	writing a buffer to a file, and restores undo history from the same
 	file on buffer read.
 	The directory where the undo file is stored is specified by `'undodir'` .
 	For more information about this feature see |undo-persistence|.
 	The undo file is not read when `'undoreload'`  causes the buffer from
 	before a reload to be saved for undo.
 	When `'undofile'`  is turned off the undo file is NOT deleted.

## undolevels


```lua
integer
```

 `'undolevels'`  `'ul'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Maximum number of changes that can be undone.  Since undo information
 	is kept in memory, higher numbers will cause more memory to be used.
 	Nevertheless, a single change can already use a large amount of memory.
 	Set to 0 for Vi compatibility: One level of undo and "u" undoes
 	itself: >
 		set ul=0
 <	But you can also get Vi compatibility by including the `'u'`  flag in
 	`'cpoptions'` , and still be able to use CTRL-R to repeat undo.
 	Also see |undo-two-ways|.
 	Set to -1 for no undo at all.  You might want to do this only for the
 	current buffer: >
 		setlocal ul=-1
 <	This helps when you run out of memory for a single change.
 
 	The local value is set to -123456 when the global value is to be used.
 
 	Also see |clear-undo|.

## varsofttabstop


```lua
string
```

 `'varsofttabstop'`  `'vsts'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	A list of the number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while editing,
 	such as inserting a <Tab> or using <BS>.  It "feels" like variable-
 	width <Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mixture of spaces
 	and <Tab>s is used.  Tab widths are separated with commas, with the
 	final value applying to all subsequent tabs.
 
 	For example, when editing assembly language files where statements
 	start in the 9th column and comments in the 41st, it may be useful
 	to use the following: >
 		:set varsofttabstop=8,32,8
 <	This will set soft tabstops with 8 and 8 + 32 spaces, and 8 more
 	for every column thereafter.
 
 	Note that the value of |`'softtabstop'` | will be ignored while
 	`'varsofttabstop'`  is set.

## vartabstop


```lua
string
```

 `'vartabstop'`  `'vts'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	A list of the number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for,
 	separated by commas.  Each value corresponds to one tab, with the
 	final value applying to all subsequent tabs. For example: >
 		:set vartabstop=4,20,10,8
 <	This will make the first tab 4 spaces wide, the second 20 spaces,
 	the third 10 spaces, and all following tabs 8 spaces.
 
 	Note that the value of |`'tabstop'` | will be ignored while `'vartabstop'` 
 	is set.

## vsts


```lua
string
```

## vts


```lua
string
```

## wm


```lua
integer
```

## wrapmargin


```lua
integer
```

 `'wrapmargin'`  `'wm'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of characters from the right window border where wrapping
 	starts.  When typing text beyond this limit, an <EOL> will be inserted
 	and inserting continues on the next line.
 	Options that add a margin, such as `'number'`  and `'foldcolumn'` , cause
 	the text width to be further reduced.
 	When `'textwidth'`  is non-zero, this option is not used.
 	See also `'formatoptions'`  and |ins-textwidth|.

## allowrevins


```lua
boolean
```

 `'allowrevins'`  `'ari'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Allow CTRL-_ in Insert and Command-line mode.  This is default off, to
 	avoid that users that accidentally type CTRL-_ instead of SHIFT-_ get
 	into reverse Insert mode, and don't know how to get out.  See
 	`'revins'` .

## ambiwidth


```lua
string
```

 `'ambiwidth'`  `'ambw'` 	string (default: "single")
 			global
 	Tells Vim what to do with characters with East Asian Width Class
 	Ambiguous (such as Euro, Registered Sign, Copyright Sign, Greek
 	letters, Cyrillic letters).
 
 	There are currently two possible values:
 	"single":	Use the same width as characters in US-ASCII.  This is
 			expected by most users.
 	"double":	Use twice the width of ASCII characters.
 
 	The value "double" cannot be used if `'listchars'`  or `'fillchars'` 
 	contains a character that would be double width.  These errors may
 	also be given when calling setcellwidths().
 
 	The values are overruled for characters specified with
 	|setcellwidths()|.
 
 	There are a number of CJK fonts for which the width of glyphs for
 	those characters are solely based on how many octets they take in
 	legacy/traditional CJK encodings.  In those encodings, Euro,
 	Registered sign, Greek/Cyrillic letters are represented by two octets,
 	therefore those fonts have "wide" glyphs for them.  This is also
 	true of some line drawing characters used to make tables in text
 	file.  Therefore, when a CJK font is used for GUI Vim or
 	Vim is running inside a terminal (emulators) that uses a CJK font
 	(or Vim is run inside an xterm invoked with "-cjkwidth" option.),
 	this option should be set to "double" to match the width perceived
 	by Vim with the width of glyphs in the font.  Perhaps it also has
 	to be set to "double" under CJK MS-Windows when the system locale is
 	set to one of CJK locales.  See Unicode Standard Annex #11
 	(https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11).

## ambw


```lua
string

## arabicshape


```lua
boolean
```

 `'arabicshape'`  `'arshape'` 	boolean (default on)
 			global
 	When on and `'termbidi'`  is off, the required visual character
 	corrections that need to take place for displaying the Arabic language
 	take effect.  Shaping, in essence, gets enabled; the term is a broad
 	one which encompasses:
 	  a) the changing/morphing of characters based on their location
 	     within a word (initial, medial, final and stand-alone).
 	  b) the enabling of the ability to compose characters
 	  c) the enabling of the required combining of some characters
 	When disabled the display shows each character's true stand-alone
 	form.
 	Arabic is a complex language which requires other settings, for
 	further details see |arabic.txt|.

## ari


```lua
boolean
```

## arshape


```lua
boolean
```

## autochdir


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autochdir'`  `'acd'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When on, Vim will change the current working directory whenever you
 	open a file, switch buffers, delete a buffer or open/close a window.
 	It will change to the directory containing the file which was opened
 	or selected.  When a buffer has no name it also has no directory, thus
 	the current directory won't change when navigating to it.
 	Note: When this option is on some plugins may not work.

## autowrite


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autowrite'`  `'aw'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Write the contents of the file, if it has been modified, on each
 	`:next`, `:rewind`, `:last`, `:first`, `:previous`, `:stop`,
 	`:suspend`, `:tag`, `:!`, `:make`, CTRL-] and CTRL-^ command; and when
 	a `:buffer`, CTRL-O, CTRL-I, '{A-Z0-9}, or `{A-Z0-9} command takes one
 	to another file.
 	A buffer is not written if it becomes hidden, e.g. when `'bufhidden'`  is
 	set to "hide" and `:next` is used.
 	Note that for some commands the `'autowrite'`  option is not used, see
 	`'autowriteall'`  for that.
 	Some buffers will not be written, specifically when `'buftype'`  is
 	"nowrite", "nofile", "terminal" or "prompt".

## autowriteall


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autowriteall'`  `'awa'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Like `'autowrite'` , but also used for commands ":edit", ":enew", ":quit",
 	":qall", ":exit", ":xit", ":recover" and closing the Vim window.
 	Setting this option also implies that Vim behaves like `'autowrite'`  has
 	been set.

## aw


```lua
boolean
```

## awa


```lua
boolean
```

## background


```lua
string
```

 `'background'`  `'bg'` 	string	(default "dark")
 			global
 	When set to "dark" or "light", adjusts the default color groups for
 	that background type.  The |TUI| or other UI sets this on startup
 	(triggering |OptionSet|) if it can detect the background color.
 
 	This option does NOT change the background color, it tells Nvim what
 	the "inherited" (terminal/GUI) background looks like.
 	See |:hi-normal| if you want to set the background color explicitly.
 
 	When a color scheme is loaded (the "g:colors_name" variable is set)
 	setting `'background'`  will cause the color scheme to be reloaded.  If
 	the color scheme adjusts to the value of `'background'`  this will work.
 	However, if the color scheme sets `'background'`  itself the effect may
 	be undone.  First delete the "g:colors_name" variable when needed.
 
 	Normally this option would be set in the vimrc file.  Possibly
 	depending on the terminal name.  Example: >
 		:if $TERM ==# "xterm"
 		:  set background=dark
 		:endif
 <	When this option is set, the default settings for the highlight groups
 	will change.  To use other settings, place ":highlight" commands AFTER
 	the setting of the `'background'`  option.
 	This option is also used in the "$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim" file
 	to select the colors for syntax highlighting.  After changing this
 	option, you must load syntax.vim again to see the result.  This can be
 	done with ":syntax on".

## backspace


```lua
string
```

 `'backspace'`  `'bs'` 	string	(default "indent,eol,start")
 			global
 	Influences the working of <BS>, <Del>, CTRL-W and CTRL-U in Insert
 	mode.  This is a list of items, separated by commas.  Each item allows
 	a way to backspace over something:
 	value	effect	~
 	indent	allow backspacing over autoindent
 	eol	allow backspacing over line breaks (join lines)
 	start	allow backspacing over the start of insert; CTRL-W and CTRL-U
 		stop once at the start of insert.
 	nostop	like start, except CTRL-W and CTRL-U do not stop at the start of
 		insert.
 
 	When the value is empty, Vi compatible backspacing is used, none of
 	the ways mentioned for the items above are possible.
 
 	For backwards compatibility with version 5.4 and earlier:
 	value	effect	~
 	  0	same as ":set backspace=" (Vi compatible)
 	  1	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol"
 	  2	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol,start"
 	  3	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol,nostop"

## backup


```lua
boolean
```

 `'backup'`  `'bk'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  Leave it around after the
 	file has been successfully written.  If you do not want to keep the
 	backup file, but you do want a backup while the file is being
 	written, reset this option and set the `'writebackup'`  option (this is
 	the default).  If you do not want a backup file at all reset both
 	options (use this if your file system is almost full).  See the
 	|backup-table| for more explanations.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
 	When `'patchmode'`  is set, the backup may be renamed to become the
 	oldest version of a file.

## backupdir


```lua
string
```

 `'backupdir'`  `'bdir'` 	string	(default ".,$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/backup//")
 			global
 	List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
 	- The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
 	  where this is possible.  If none of the directories exist Nvim will
 	  attempt to create the last directory in the list.
 	- Empty means that no backup file will be created (`'patchmode'`  is
 	  impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
 	- A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
 	  as the edited file.
 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
 	  the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
 	  ("." inside a directory name has no special meaning).
 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
 	- A directory name may end in an `'/'` .
 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
 	  with all path separators changed to percent `'%'`  signs. This will
 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the backup directory.
 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
 	  use `'//'` , instead of `'\\'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type one before a space, type two to
 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
 	    :set bdir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
 <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a `'>'`  at the start
 	  of the option is removed.
 	See also `'backup'`  and `'writebackup'`  options.
 	If you want to hide your backup files on Unix, consider this value: >
 		:set backupdir=./.backup,~/.backup,.,/tmp
 <	You must create a ".backup" directory in each directory and in your
 	home directory for this to work properly.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## backupext


```lua
string
```

 `'backupext'`  `'bex'` 	string	(default "~")
 			global
 	String which is appended to a file name to make the name of the
 	backup file.  The default is quite unusual, because this avoids
 	accidentally overwriting existing files with a backup file.  You might
 	prefer using ".bak", but make sure that you don't have files with
 	".bak" that you want to keep.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used; "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
 
 	If you like to keep a lot of backups, you could use a BufWritePre
 	autocommand to change `'backupext'`  just before writing the file to
 	include a timestamp. >
 		:au BufWritePre * let &bex = `'-'`  .. strftime("%Y%b%d%X") .. `'~'` 
 <	Use `'backupdir'`  to put the backup in a different directory.

## backupskip


```lua
string
```

 `'backupskip'`  `'bsk'` 	string	(default: "$TMPDIR/,$TEMP/*"
 				 Unix: "/tmp/,$TMP/"
 				 Mac: "/private/tmp/,$TMP/")
 			global
 	A list of file patterns.  When one of the patterns matches with the
 	name of the file which is written, no backup file is created.  Both
 	the specified file name and the full path name of the file are used.
 	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-pattern|.
 	Watch out for special characters, see |option-backslash|.
 	When $TMPDIR, $TMP or $TEMP is not defined, it is not used for the
 	default value.  "/tmp/*" is only used for Unix.
 
 	WARNING: Not having a backup file means that when Vim fails to write
 	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
 	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only disable
 	backups if you don't care about losing the file.
 
 	Note that environment variables are not expanded.  If you want to use
 	$HOME you must expand it explicitly, e.g.: >
 		:let &backupskip = escape(expand(`'$HOME'` ), `'\'` ) .. `'/tmp/*'` 
 
 <	Note that the default also makes sure that "crontab -e" works (when a
 	backup would be made by renaming the original file crontab won't see
 	the newly created file).  Also see `'backupcopy'`  and |crontab|.

## bdir


```lua
string
```

## belloff


```lua
string
```

 `'belloff'`  `'bo'` 		string	(default "all")
 			global
 	Specifies for which events the bell will not be rung. It is a comma-
 	separated list of items. For each item that is present, the bell
 	will be silenced. This is most useful to specify specific events in
 	insert mode to be silenced.
 
 	item	    meaning when present	~
 	all	    All events.
 	backspace   When hitting <BS> or <Del> and deleting results in an
 		    error.
 	cursor	    Fail to move around using the cursor keys or
 		    <PageUp>/<PageDown> in |Insert-mode|.
 	complete    Error occurred when using |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K| or
 		    |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.
 	copy	    Cannot copy char from insert mode using |i_CTRL-Y| or
 		    |i_CTRL-E|.
 	ctrlg	    Unknown Char after <C-G> in Insert mode.
 	error	    Other Error occurred (e.g. try to join last line)
 		    (mostly used in |Normal-mode| or |Cmdline-mode|).
 	esc	    hitting <Esc> in |Normal-mode|.
 	hangul	    Ignored.
 	lang	    Calling the beep module for Lua/Mzscheme/TCL.
 	mess	    No output available for |g<|.
 	showmatch   Error occurred for `'showmatch'`  function.
 	operator    Empty region error |cpo-E|.
 	register    Unknown register after <C-R> in |Insert-mode|.
 	shell	    Bell from shell output |:!|.
 	spell	    Error happened on spell suggest.
 	wildmode    More matches in |cmdline-completion| available
 		    (depends on the `'wildmode'`  setting).
 
 	This is most useful to fine tune when in Insert mode the bell should
 	be rung. For Normal mode and Ex commands, the bell is often rung to
 	indicate that an error occurred. It can be silenced by adding the
 	"error" keyword.

## bex


```lua
string
```

## bg


```lua
string
```

## bk


```lua
boolean
```

## bo


```lua
string
```

## breakat


```lua
string
```

 `'breakat'`  `'brk'` 		string	(default " ^I!@*-+;:,./?")
 			global
 	This option lets you choose which characters might cause a line
 	break if `'linebreak'`  is on.  Only works for ASCII characters.

## brk


```lua
string
```

## browsedir


```lua
string
```

 `'browsedir'`  `'bsdir'` 	string	(default: "last")
 			global
 	Which directory to use for the file browser:
 	   last		Use same directory as with last file browser, where a
 			file was opened or saved.
 	   buffer	Use the directory of the related buffer.
 	   current	Use the current directory.
 	   {path}	Use the specified directory

## bs


```lua
string
```

## bsdir


```lua
string
```

## bsk


```lua
string
```

## casemap


```lua
string
```

 `'casemap'`  `'cmp'` 		string	(default: "internal,keepascii")
 			global
 	Specifies details about changing the case of letters.  It may contain
 	these words, separated by a comma:
 	internal	Use internal case mapping functions, the current
 			locale does not change the case mapping. When
 			"internal" is omitted, the towupper() and towlower()
 			system library functions are used when available.
 	keepascii	For the ASCII characters (0x00 to 0x7f) use the US
 			case mapping, the current locale is not effective.
 			This probably only matters for Turkish.

## cb


```lua
string
```

## ccv


```lua
string
```

## cd


```lua
string
```

## cdh


```lua
boolean
```

## cdhome


```lua
boolean
```

 `'cdhome'`  `'cdh'` 		boolean	(default: off)
 			global
 	When on, |:cd|, |:tcd| and |:lcd| without an argument changes the
 	current working directory to the |$HOME| directory like in Unix.
 	When off, those commands just print the current directory name.
 	On Unix this option has no effect.

## cdpath


```lua
string
```

 `'cdpath'`  `'cd'` 		string	(default: equivalent to $CDPATH or ",,")
 			global
 	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
 	|:cd|, |:tcd| and |:lcd| commands, provided that the directory being
 	searched for has a relative path, not an absolute part starting with
 	"/", "./" or "../", the `'cdpath'`  option is not used then.
 	The `'cdpath'`  option's value has the same form and semantics as
 	|`'path'` |.  Also see |file-searching|.
 	The default value is taken from $CDPATH, with a "," prepended to look
 	in the current directory first.
 	If the default value taken from $CDPATH is not what you want, include
 	a modified version of the following command in your vimrc file to
 	override it: >
 	  :let &cdpath = `','`  .. substitute(substitute($CDPATH, '[, ]', `'\\\0'` , `'g'` ), `':'` , `','` , `'g'` )
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.
 	(parts of `'cdpath'`  can be passed to the shell to expand file names).

## cedit


```lua
string
```

 `'cedit'` 			string	(default: CTRL-F)
 			global
 	The key used in Command-line Mode to open the command-line window.
 	Only non-printable keys are allowed.
 	The key can be specified as a single character, but it is difficult to
 	type.  The preferred way is to use the <> notation.  Examples: >
 		:exe "set cedit=\<C-Y>"
 		:exe "set cedit=\<Esc>"
 <	|Nvi| also has this option, but it only uses the first character.
 	See |cmdwin|.

## cf


```lua
boolean
```

## ch


```lua
integer
```

## charconvert


```lua
string
```

 `'charconvert'`  `'ccv'` 	string (default "")
 			global
 	An expression that is used for character encoding conversion.  It is
 	evaluated when a file that is to be read or has been written has a
 	different encoding from what is desired.
 	`'charconvert'`  is not used when the internal iconv() function is
 	supported and is able to do the conversion.  Using iconv() is
 	preferred, because it is much faster.
 	`'charconvert'`  is not used when reading stdin |--|, because there is no
 	file to convert from.  You will have to save the text in a file first.
 	The expression must return zero, false or an empty string for success,
 	non-zero or true for failure.
 	See |encoding-names| for possible encoding names.
 	Additionally, names given in `'fileencodings'`  and `'fileencoding'`  are
 	used.
 	Conversion between "latin1", "unicode", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" and "utf-8"
 	is done internally by Vim, `'charconvert'`  is not used for this.
 	Also used for Unicode conversion.
 	Example: >
 		set charconvert=CharConvert()
 		fun CharConvert()
 		  system("recode "
 			\ .. v:charconvert_from .. ".." .. v:charconvert_to
 			\ .. " <" .. v:fname_in .. " >" .. v:fname_out)
 		  return v:shell_error
 		endfun
 <	The related Vim variables are:
 		v:charconvert_from	name of the current encoding
 		v:charconvert_to	name of the desired encoding
 		v:fname_in		name of the input file
 		v:fname_out		name of the output file
 	Note that v:fname_in and v:fname_out will never be the same.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## clipboard


```lua
string
```

 `'clipboard'`  `'cb'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This option is a list of comma-separated names.
 	These names are recognized:
 
 
 	unnamed		When included, Vim will use the clipboard register "*"
 			for all yank, delete, change and put operations which
 			would normally go to the unnamed register.  When a
 			register is explicitly specified, it will always be
 			used regardless of whether "unnamed" is in `'clipboard'` 
 			or not.  The clipboard register can always be
 			explicitly accessed using the "* notation.  Also see
 			|clipboard|.
 
 
 	unnamedplus	A variant of the "unnamed" flag which uses the
 			clipboard register "+" (|quoteplus|) instead of
 			register "*" for all yank, delete, change and put
 			operations which would normally go to the unnamed
 			register.  When "unnamed" is also included to the
 			option, yank and delete operations (but not put)
 			will additionally copy the text into register
 			`'*'` . See |clipboard|.

## cmdheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'cmdheight'`  `'ch'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global or local to tab page
 	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line.  Helps avoiding
 	|hit-enter| prompts.
 	The value of this option is stored with the tab page, so that each tab
 	page can have a different value.
 
 	When `'cmdheight'`  is zero, there is no command-line unless it is being
 	used.  The command-line will cover the last line of the screen when
 	shown.
 
 	WARNING: `cmdheight=0` is considered experimental. Expect some
 	unwanted behaviour. Some `'shortmess'`  flags and similar
 	mechanism might fail to take effect, causing unwanted hit-enter
 	prompts.  Some informative messages, both from Nvim itself and
 	plugins, will not be displayed.

## cmdwinheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'cmdwinheight'`  `'cwh'` 	number	(default 7)
 			global
 	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line window. |cmdwin|

## cmp


```lua
string
```

## co


```lua
integer
```

## columns


```lua
integer
```

 `'columns'`  `'co'` 		number	(default 80 or terminal width)
 			global
 	Number of columns of the screen.  Normally this is set by the terminal
 	initialization and does not have to be set by hand.
 	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
 	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
 	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |ginit.vim| file.
 	When you set this option and Vim is unable to change the physical
 	number of columns of the display, the display may be messed up.  For
 	the GUI it is always possible and Vim limits the number of columns to
 	what fits on the screen.  You can use this command to get the widest
 	window possible: >
 		:set columns=9999
 <	Minimum value is 12, maximum value is 10000.

## compatible


```lua
boolean
```

## completeopt


```lua
string
```

 `'completeopt'`  `'cot'` 	string	(default: "menu,preview")
 			global
 	A comma-separated list of options for Insert mode completion
 	|ins-completion|.  The supported values are:
 
 	   menu	    Use a popup menu to show the possible completions.  The
 		    menu is only shown when there is more than one match and
 		    sufficient colors are available.  |ins-completion-menu|
 
 	   menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
 		    Useful when there is additional information about the
 		    match, e.g., what file it comes from.
 
 	   longest  Only insert the longest common text of the matches.  If
 		    the menu is displayed you can use CTRL-L to add more
 		    characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
 		    of completion.  For buffer text the `'ignorecase'`  option is
 		    used.
 
 	   preview  Show extra information about the currently selected
 		    completion in the preview window.  Only works in
 		    combination with "menu" or "menuone".
 
 	  noinsert  Do not insert any text for a match until the user selects
 		    a match from the menu. Only works in combination with
 		    "menu" or "menuone". No effect if "longest" is present.
 
 	  noselect  Do not select a match in the menu, force the user to
 		    select one from the menu. Only works in combination with
 		    "menu" or "menuone".

## completeslash


```lua
string
```

 `'completeslash'`  `'csl'` 	string	(default: "")
 			local to buffer
 			{only for MS-Windows}
 	When this option is set it overrules `'shellslash'`  for completion:
 	- When this option is set to "slash", a forward slash is used for path
 	  completion in insert mode. This is useful when editing HTML tag, or
 	  Makefile with `'noshellslash'`  on MS-Windows.
 	- When this option is set to "backslash", backslash is used. This is
 	  useful when editing a batch file with `'shellslash'`  set on MS-Windows.
 	- When this option is empty, same character is used as for
 	  `'shellslash'` .
 	For Insert mode completion the buffer-local value is used.  For
 	command line completion the global value is used.

## confirm


```lua
boolean
```

 `'confirm'`  `'cf'` 		boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When `'confirm'`  is on, certain operations that would normally
 	fail because of unsaved changes to a buffer, e.g. ":q" and ":e",
 	instead raise a dialog asking if you wish to save the current
 	file(s).  You can still use a ! to unconditionally |abandon| a buffer.
 	If `'confirm'`  is off you can still activate confirmation for one
 	command only (this is most useful in mappings) with the |:confirm|
 	command.
 	Also see the |confirm()| function and the `'v'`  flag in `'guioptions'` .

## cot


```lua
string
```

## cp


```lua
boolean
```

## cpo


```lua
string
```

## cpoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'cpoptions'`  `'cpo'` 	string	(default: "aABceFs_")
 			global
 	A sequence of single character flags.  When a character is present
 	this indicates Vi-compatible behavior.  This is used for things where
 	not being Vi-compatible is mostly or sometimes preferred.
 	`'cpoptions'`  stands for "compatible-options".
 	Commas can be added for readability.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
 
 	    contains	behavior	~
 
 		a	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
 			argument will set the alternate file name for the
 			current window.
 
 		A	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
 			argument will set the alternate file name for the
 			current window.
 
 		b	"\|" in a ":map" command is recognized as the end of
 			the map command.  The `'\'`  is included in the mapping,
 			the text after the `'|'`  is interpreted as the next
 			command.  Use a CTRL-V instead of a backslash to
 			include the `'|'`  in the mapping.  Applies to all
 			mapping, abbreviation, menu and autocmd commands.
 			See also |map_bar|.
 
 		B	A backslash has no special meaning in mappings,
 			abbreviations, user commands and the "to" part of the
 			menu commands.  Remove this flag to be able to use a
 			backslash like a CTRL-V.  For example, the command
 			":map X \<Esc>" results in X being mapped to:
 				`'B'`  included:	"\^["	 (^[ is a real <Esc>)
 				`'B'`  excluded:	"<Esc>"  (5 characters)
 
 		c	Searching continues at the end of any match at the
 			cursor position, but not further than the start of the
 			next line.  When not present searching continues
 			one character from the cursor position.  With `'c'` 
 			"abababababab" only gets three matches when repeating
 			"/abab", without `'c'`  there are five matches.
 
 		C	Do not concatenate sourced lines that start with a
 			backslash.  See |line-continuation|.
 
 		d	Using "./" in the `'tags'`  option doesn't mean to use
 			the tags file relative to the current file, but the
 			tags file in the current directory.
 
 		D	Can't use CTRL-K to enter a digraph after Normal mode
 			commands with a character argument, like |r|, |f| and
 			|t|.
 
 		e	When executing a register with ":@r", always add a
 			<CR> to the last line, also when the register is not
 			linewise.  If this flag is not present, the register
 			is not linewise and the last line does not end in a
 			<CR>, then the last line is put on the command-line
 			and can be edited before hitting <CR>.
 
 		E	It is an error when using "y", "d", "c", "g~", "gu" or
 			"gU" on an Empty region.  The operators only work when
 			at least one character is to be operated on.  Example:
 			This makes "y0" fail in the first column.
 
 		f	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
 			argument will set the file name for the current buffer,
 			if the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet.
 
 		F	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
 			argument will set the file name for the current
 			buffer, if the current buffer doesn't have a file name
 			yet.  Also see |cpo-P|.
 
 		i	When included, interrupting the reading of a file will
 			leave it modified.
 
 		I	When moving the cursor up or down just after inserting
 			indent for `'autoindent'` , do not delete the indent.
 
 		J	A |sentence| has to be followed by two spaces after
 			the `'.'` , `'!'`  or `'?'` .  A <Tab> is not recognized as
 			white space.
 
 		K	Don't wait for a key code to complete when it is
 			halfway through a mapping.  This breaks mapping
 			<F1><F1> when only part of the second <F1> has been
 			read.  It enables cancelling the mapping by typing
 			<F1><Esc>.
 
 		l	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
 			literally, only "\]", "\^", "\-" and "\\" are special.
 			See |/[]|
 			   `'l'`  included: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space>, `'\'`  and `'t'` 
 			   `'l'`  excluded: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space> and <Tab>
 
 		L	When the `'list'`  option is set, `'wrapmargin'` ,
 			`'textwidth'` , `'softtabstop'`  and Virtual Replace mode
 			(see |gR|) count a <Tab> as two characters, instead of
 			the normal behavior of a <Tab>.
 
 		m	When included, a showmatch will always wait half a
 			second.  When not included, a showmatch will wait half
 			a second or until a character is typed.  |`'showmatch'` |
 
 		M	When excluded, "%" matching will take backslashes into
 			account.  Thus in "( \( )" and "\( ( \)" the outer
 			parenthesis match.  When included "%" ignores
 			backslashes, which is Vi compatible.
 
 		n	When included, the column used for `'number'`  and
 			`'relativenumber'`  will also be used for text of wrapped
 			lines.
 
 		o	Line offset to search command is not remembered for
 			next search.
 
 		O	Don't complain if a file is being overwritten, even
 			when it didn't exist when editing it.  This is a
 			protection against a file unexpectedly created by
 			someone else.  Vi didn't complain about this.
 
 		p	Vi compatible Lisp indenting.  When not present, a
 			slightly better algorithm is used.
 
 		P	When included, a ":write" command that appends to a
 			file will set the file name for the current buffer, if
 			the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet and
 			the `'F'`  flag is also included |cpo-F|.
 
 		q	When joining multiple lines leave the cursor at the
 			position where it would be when joining two lines.
 
 		r	Redo ("." command) uses "/" to repeat a search
 			command, instead of the actually used search string.
 
 		R	Remove marks from filtered lines.  Without this flag
 			marks are kept like |:keepmarks| was used.
 
 		s	Set buffer options when entering the buffer for the
 			first time.  This is like it is in Vim version 3.0.
 			And it is the default.  If not present the options are
 			set when the buffer is created.
 
 		S	Set buffer options always when entering a buffer
 			(except `'readonly'` , `'fileformat'` , `'filetype'`  and
 			`'syntax'` ).  This is the (most) Vi compatible setting.
 			The options are set to the values in the current
 			buffer.  When you change an option and go to another
 			buffer, the value is copied.  Effectively makes the
 			buffer options global to all buffers.
 
 			`'s'`     `'S'`      copy buffer options
 			no     no      when buffer created
 			yes    no      when buffer first entered (default)
 			 X     yes     each time when buffer entered (vi comp.)
 
 		t	Search pattern for the tag command is remembered for
 			"n" command.  Otherwise Vim only puts the pattern in
 			the history for search pattern, but doesn't change the
 			last used search pattern.
 
 		u	Undo is Vi compatible.  See |undo-two-ways|.
 
 		v	Backspaced characters remain visible on the screen in
 			Insert mode.  Without this flag the characters are
 			erased from the screen right away.  With this flag the
 			screen newly typed text overwrites backspaced
 			characters.
 
 		W	Don't overwrite a readonly file.  When omitted, ":w!"
 			overwrites a readonly file, if possible.
 
 		x	<Esc> on the command-line executes the command-line.
 			The default in Vim is to abandon the command-line,
 			because <Esc> normally aborts a command.  |c_<Esc>|
 
 		X	When using a count with "R" the replaced text is
 			deleted only once.  Also when repeating "R" with "."
 			and a count.
 
 		y	A yank command can be redone with ".".  Think twice if
 			you really want to use this, it may break some
 			plugins, since most people expect "." to only repeat a
 			change.
 
 		Z	When using "w!" while the `'readonly'`  option is set,
 			don't reset `'readonly'` .
 
 		!	When redoing a filter command, use the last used
 			external command, whatever it was.  Otherwise the last
 			used -filter- command is used.
 
 		$	When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the
 			line, but put a `'$'`  at the end of the changed text.
 			The changed text will be overwritten when you type the
 			new text.  The line is redisplayed if you type any
 			command that moves the cursor from the insertion
 			point.
 
 		%	Vi-compatible matching is done for the "%" command.
 			Does not recognize "#if", "#endif", etc.
 			Does not recognize "/*" and "*/".
 			Parens inside single and double quotes are also
 			counted, causing a string that contains a paren to
 			disturb the matching.  For example, in a line like
 			"if (strcmp("foo(", s))" the first paren does not
 			match the last one.  When this flag is not included,
 			parens inside single and double quotes are treated
 			specially.  When matching a paren outside of quotes,
 			everything inside quotes is ignored.  When matching a
 			paren inside quotes, it will find the matching one (if
 			there is one).  This works very well for C programs.
 			This flag is also used for other features, such as
 			C-indenting.
 
 		+	When included, a ":write file" command will reset the
 			`'modified'`  flag of the buffer, even though the buffer
 			itself may still be different from its file.
 
 		>	When appending to a register, put a line break before
 			the appended text.
 
 		;	When using |,| or |;| to repeat the last |t| search
 			and the cursor is right in front of the searched
 			character, the cursor won't move. When not included,
 			the cursor would skip over it and jump to the
 			following occurrence.
 
 		_	When using |cw| on a word, do not include the
 			whitespace following the word in the motion.

## csl


```lua
string
```

## cwh


```lua
integer
```

## debug


```lua
string
```

 `'debug'` 			string	(default "")
 			global
 	These values can be used:
 	msg	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
 		anyway.
 	throw	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
 		anyway and also throw an exception and set |v:errmsg|.
 	beep	A message will be given when otherwise only a beep would be
 		produced.
 	The values can be combined, separated by a comma.
 	"msg" and "throw" are useful for debugging `'foldexpr'` , `'formatexpr'`  or
 	`'indentexpr'` .

## deco


```lua
boolean
```

## delcombine


```lua
boolean
```

 `'delcombine'`  `'deco'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	If editing Unicode and this option is set, backspace and Normal mode
 	"x" delete each combining character on its own.  When it is off (the
 	default) the character along with its combining characters are
 	deleted.
 	Note: When `'delcombine'`  is set "xx" may work differently from "2x"!
 
 	This is useful for Arabic, Hebrew and many other languages where one
 	may have combining characters overtop of base characters, and want
 	to remove only the combining ones.

## dex


```lua
string
```

## dg


```lua
boolean
```

## diffexpr


```lua
string
```

 `'diffexpr'`  `'dex'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	Expression which is evaluated to obtain a diff file (either ed-style
 	or unified-style) from two versions of a file.  See |diff-diffexpr|.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## diffopt


```lua
string
```

 `'diffopt'`  `'dip'` 		string	(default "internal,filler,closeoff")
 			global
 	Option settings for diff mode.  It can consist of the following items.
 	All are optional.  Items must be separated by a comma.
 
 		filler		Show filler lines, to keep the text
 				synchronized with a window that has inserted
 				lines at the same position.  Mostly useful
 				when windows are side-by-side and `'scrollbind'` 
 				is set.
 
 		context:{n}	Use a context of {n} lines between a change
 				and a fold that contains unchanged lines.
 				When omitted a context of six lines is used.
 				When using zero the context is actually one,
 				since folds require a line in between, also
 				for a deleted line.
 				See |fold-diff|.
 
 		iblank		Ignore changes where lines are all blank.  Adds
 				the "-B" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.
 				NOTE: the diff windows will get out of sync,
 				because no differences between blank lines are
 				taken into account.
 
 		icase		Ignore changes in case of text.  "a" and "A"
 				are considered the same.  Adds the "-i" flag
 				to the "diff" command if `'diffexpr'`  is empty.
 
 		iwhite		Ignore changes in amount of white space.  Adds
 				the "-b" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.  It should ignore adding trailing
 				white space, but not leading white space.
 
 		iwhiteall	Ignore all white space changes.  Adds
 				the "-w" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.
 
 		iwhiteeol	Ignore white space changes at end of line.
 				Adds the "-Z" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.
 
 		horizontal	Start diff mode with horizontal splits (unless
 				explicitly specified otherwise).
 
 		vertical	Start diff mode with vertical splits (unless
 				explicitly specified otherwise).
 
 		closeoff	When a window is closed where `'diff'`  is set
 				and there is only one window remaining in the
 				same tab page with `'diff'`  set, execute
 				`:diffoff` in that window.  This undoes a
 				`:diffsplit` command.
 
 		hiddenoff	Do not use diff mode for a buffer when it
 				becomes hidden.
 
 		foldcolumn:{n}	Set the `'foldcolumn'`  option to {n} when
 				starting diff mode.  Without this 2 is used.
 
 		followwrap	Follow the `'wrap'`  option and leave as it is.
 
 		internal	Use the internal diff library.  This is
 				ignored when `'diffexpr'`  is set.
 				When running out of memory when writing a
 				buffer this item will be ignored for diffs
 				involving that buffer.  Set the `'verbose'` 
 				option to see when this happens.
 
 		indent-heuristic
 				Use the indent heuristic for the internal
 				diff library.
 
 		linematch:{n}   Enable a second stage diff on each generated
 				hunk in order to align lines. When the total
 				number of lines in a hunk exceeds {n}, the
 				second stage diff will not be performed as
 				very large hunks can cause noticeable lag. A
 				recommended setting is "linematch:60", as this
 				will enable alignment for a 2 buffer diff with
 				hunks of up to 30 lines each, or a 3 buffer
 				diff with hunks of up to 20 lines each.
 
                 algorithm:{text} Use the specified diff algorithm with the
 				internal diff engine. Currently supported
 				algorithms are:
 				myers      the default algorithm
 				minimal    spend extra time to generate the
 					   smallest possible diff
 				patience   patience diff algorithm
 				histogram  histogram diff algorithm
 
 	Examples: >
 		:set diffopt=internal,filler,context:4
 		:set diffopt=
 		:set diffopt=internal,filler,foldcolumn:3
 		:set diffopt-=internal  " do NOT use the internal diff parser
 <

## digraph


```lua
boolean
```

 `'digraph'`  `'dg'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Enable the entering of digraphs in Insert mode with {char1} <BS>
 	{char2}.  See |digraphs|.

## dip


```lua
string
```

## dir


```lua
string
```

## directory


```lua
string
```

 `'directory'`  `'dir'` 	string	(default "$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/swap//")
 			global
 	List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.
 
 	Possible items:
 	- The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
 	  possible.  If it is not possible in any directory, but last
 	  directory listed in the option does not exist, it is created.
 	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
 	  impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
 	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
 	  the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading "."
 	  is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
 	  with all path separators replaced by percent `'%'`  signs (including
 	  the colon following the drive letter on Win32). This will ensure
 	  file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
 	  use `'//'` , instead of `'\\'` .
 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
 	- A directory name may end in an `':'`  or `'/'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type one before a space, type two to
 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
 	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
 <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a `'>'`  at the start
 	  of the option is removed.
 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
 	choice than "/tmp".  But others on the computer may be able to see the
 	files, and it can contain a lot of files, your swap files get lost in
 	the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your home directory is
 	tried first.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## display


```lua
string
```

 `'display'`  `'dy'` 		string	(default "lastline")
 			global
 	Change the way text is displayed.  This is a comma-separated list of
 	flags:
 	lastline	When included, as much as possible of the last line
 			in a window will be displayed.  "@@@" is put in the
 			last columns of the last screen line to indicate the
 			rest of the line is not displayed.
 	truncate	Like "lastline", but "@@@" is displayed in the first
 			column of the last screen line.  Overrules "lastline".
 	uhex		Show unprintable characters hexadecimal as <xx>
 			instead of using ^C and ~C.
 	msgsep		Obsolete flag. Allowed but takes no effect. |msgsep|
 
 	When neither "lastline" nor "truncate" is included, a last line that
 	doesn't fit is replaced with "@" lines.
 
 	The "@" character can be changed by setting the "lastline" item in
 	`'fillchars'` .  The character is highlighted with |hl-NonText|.

## dy


```lua
string
```

## ea


```lua
boolean
```

## ead


```lua
string
```

## eadirection


```lua
string
```

 `'eadirection'`  `'ead'` 	string	(default "both")
 			global
 	Tells when the `'equalalways'`  option applies:
 		ver	vertically, width of windows is not affected
 		hor	horizontally, height of windows is not affected
 		both	width and height of windows is affected

## eb


```lua
boolean
```

## ed


```lua
boolean
```

## edcompatible


```lua
boolean
```

## ef


```lua
string
```

## ei


```lua
string
```

## emo


```lua
boolean
```

## emoji


```lua
boolean
```

 `'emoji'`  `'emo'` 	boolean (default: on)
 			global
 	When on all Unicode emoji characters are considered to be full width.
 	This excludes "text emoji" characters, which are normally displayed as
 	single width.  Unfortunately there is no good specification for this
 	and it has been determined on trial-and-error basis.  Use the
 	|setcellwidths()| function to change the behavior.

## enc


```lua
string
```

## encoding


```lua
string
```

 `'encoding'`  `'enc'` 
 	String-encoding used internally and for |RPC| communication.
 	Always UTF-8.
 
 	See `'fileencoding'`  to control file-content encoding.

## equalalways


```lua
boolean
```

 `'equalalways'`  `'ea'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, all the windows are automatically made the same size after
 	splitting or closing a window.  This also happens the moment the
 	option is switched on.  When off, splitting a window will reduce the
 	size of the current window and leave the other windows the same.  When
 	closing a window the extra lines are given to the window next to it
 	(depending on `'splitbelow'`  and `'splitright'` ).
 	When mixing vertically and horizontally split windows, a minimal size
 	is computed and some windows may be larger if there is room.  The
 	`'eadirection'`  option tells in which direction the size is affected.
 	Changing the height and width of a window can be avoided by setting
 	`'winfixheight'`  and `'winfixwidth'` , respectively.
 	If a window size is specified when creating a new window sizes are
 	currently not equalized (it's complicated, but may be implemented in
 	the future).

## errorbells


```lua
boolean
```

 `'errorbells'`  `'eb'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Ring the bell (beep or screen flash) for error messages.  This only
 	makes a difference for error messages, the bell will be used always
 	for a lot of errors without a message (e.g., hitting <Esc> in Normal
 	mode).  See `'visualbell'`  to make the bell behave like a screen flash
 	or do nothing. See `'belloff'`  to finetune when to ring the bell.

## errorfile


```lua
string
```

 `'errorfile'`  `'ef'` 	string	(default: "errors.err")
 			global
 	Name of the errorfile for the QuickFix mode (see |:cf|).
 	When the "-q" command-line argument is used, `'errorfile'`  is set to the
 	following argument.  See |-q|.
 	NOT used for the ":make" command.  See `'makeef'`  for that.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## eventignore


```lua
string
```

 `'eventignore'`  `'ei'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	A list of autocommand event names, which are to be ignored.
 	When set to "all" or when "all" is one of the items, all autocommand
 	events are ignored, autocommands will not be executed.
 	Otherwise this is a comma-separated list of event names.  Example: >
 	    :set ei=WinEnter,WinLeave
 <

## ex


```lua
boolean
```

## exrc


```lua
boolean
```

 `'exrc'`  `'ex'` 		boolean (default off)
 			global
 	Automatically execute .nvim.lua, .nvimrc, and .exrc files in the
 	current directory, if the file is in the |trust| list. Use |:trust| to
 	manage trusted files. See also |vim.secure.read()|.
 
 	Compare `'exrc'`  to |editorconfig|:
 	- `'exrc'`  can execute any code; editorconfig only specifies settings.
 	- `'exrc'`  is Nvim-specific; editorconfig works in other editors.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## fcl

## fileencodings


```lua
string
```

 `'fileencodings'`  `'fencs'` 	string (default: "ucs-bom,utf-8,default,latin1")
 			global
 	This is a list of character encodings considered when starting to edit
 	an existing file.  When a file is read, Vim tries to use the first
 	mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one
 	in the list is tried.  When an encoding is found that works,
 	`'fileencoding'`  is set to it.  If all fail, `'fileencoding'`  is set to
 	an empty string, which means that UTF-8 is used.
 		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use
 		the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
 		that can't be converted.
 	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
 	will work and the first entry of `'fileencodings'`  will be used (except
 	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
 	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
 	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
 		au BufReadPost * if search(`'\S'` , `'w'` ) == 0 |
 			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
 <	This sets `'fileencoding'`  to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
 	non-blank characters.
 	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of `'fileencodings'`  is
 	not used.
 	Note that `'fileencodings'`  is not used for a new file, the global value
 	of `'fileencoding'`  is used instead.  You can set it with: >
 		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
 <	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
 	an empty file.
 	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
 	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
 	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
 	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
 	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
 	accepted.
 	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
 	environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
 	encoding, such as Russian.
 	When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be
 	recognized as "utf-8".  You can use the |8g8| command to find the
 	illegal byte sequence.
 	WRONG VALUES:			WHAT'S WRONG:
 		latin1,utf-8		"latin1" will always be used
 		utf-8,ucs-bom,latin1	BOM won't be recognized in an utf-8
 					file
 		cp1250,latin1		"cp1250" will always be used
 	If `'fileencodings'`  is empty, `'fileencoding'`  is not modified.
 	See `'fileencoding'`  for the possible values.
 	Setting this option does not have an effect until the next time a file
 	is read.

## fileformats


```lua
string
```

 `'fileformats'`  `'ffs'` 	string (default:
 				Win32: "dos,unix",
 				Unix: "unix,dos")
 			global
 	This gives the end-of-line (<EOL>) formats that will be tried when
 	starting to edit a new buffer and when reading a file into an existing
 	buffer:
 	- When empty, the format defined with `'fileformat'`  will be used
 	  always.  It is not set automatically.
 	- When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
 	  is opened.  `'fileformat'`  is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
 	  `'fileformats'`  name will be used when a file is read into an existing
 	  buffer, no matter what `'fileformat'`  for that buffer is set to.
 	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
 	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
 	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
 	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and `'fileformats'`  includes "dos",
 	     `'fileformat'`  is set to "dos".
 	  2. If a <NL> is found and `'fileformats'`  includes "unix", `'fileformat'` 
 	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
 	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
 	  3. If `'fileformat'`  has not yet been set, and if a <CR> is found, and
 	     if `'fileformats'`  includes "mac", `'fileformat'`  is set to "mac".
 	     This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
 	      "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
 	      "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
 	     Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
 	     the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
 	     the first few lines, "mac" is used.
 	  4. If `'fileformat'`  is still not set, the first name from
 	     `'fileformats'`  is used.
 	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
 	  this happens like `'fileformat'`  has been set appropriately for that
 	  file only, the option is not changed.
 	When `'binary'`  is set, the value of `'fileformats'`  is not used.
 
 	When Vim starts up with an empty buffer the first item is used.  You
 	can overrule this by setting `'fileformat'`  in your .vimrc.
 
 	For systems with a Dos-like <EOL> (<CR><NL>), when reading files that
 	are ":source"ed and for vimrc files, automatic <EOL> detection may be
 	done:
 	- When `'fileformats'`  is empty, there is no automatic detection.  Dos
 	  format will be used.
 	- When `'fileformats'`  is set to one or more names, automatic detection
 	  is done.  This is based on the first <NL> in the file: If there is a
 	  <CR> in front of it, Dos format is used, otherwise Unix format is
 	  used.
 	Also see |file-formats|.

## fileignorecase


```lua
boolean
```

 `'fileignorecase'`  `'fic'` 	boolean	(default on for systems where case in file
 				 names is normally ignored)
 			global
 	When set case is ignored when using file names and directories.
 	See `'wildignorecase'`  for only ignoring case when doing completion.

## foldclose


```lua
string
```

 `'foldclose'`  `'fcl'` 	string (default "")
 			global
 	When set to "all", a fold is closed when the cursor isn't in it and
 	its level is higher than `'foldlevel'` .  Useful if you want folds to
 	automatically close when moving out of them.

## foldlevelstart


```lua
integer
```

 `'foldlevelstart'`  `'fdls'` 	number (default: -1)
 			global
 	Sets `'foldlevel'`  when starting to edit another buffer in a window.
 	Useful to always start editing with all folds closed (value zero),
 	some folds closed (one) or no folds closed (99).
 	This is done before reading any modeline, thus a setting in a modeline
 	overrules this option.  Starting to edit a file for |diff-mode| also
 	ignores this option and closes all folds.
 	It is also done before BufReadPre autocommands, to allow an autocmd to
 	overrule the `'foldlevel'`  value for specific files.
 	When the value is negative, it is not used.

## foldopen


```lua
string
```

 `'foldopen'`  `'fdo'` 	string (default: "block,hor,mark,percent,quickfix,
 							     search,tag,undo")
 			global
 	Specifies for which type of commands folds will be opened, if the
 	command moves the cursor into a closed fold.  It is a comma-separated
 	list of items.
 	NOTE: When the command is part of a mapping this option is not used.
 	Add the |zv| command to the mapping to get the same effect.
 	(rationale: the mapping may want to control opening folds itself)
 
 		item		commands ~
 		all		any
 		block		"(", "{", "[[", "[{", etc.
 		hor		horizontal movements: "l", "w", "fx", etc.
 		insert		any command in Insert mode
 		jump		far jumps: "G", "gg", etc.
 		mark		jumping to a mark: "'m", CTRL-O, etc.
 		percent		"%"
 		quickfix	":cn", ":crew", ":make", etc.
 		search		search for a pattern: "/", "n", "*", "gd", etc.
 				(not for a search pattern in a ":" command)
 				Also for |[s| and |]s|.
 		tag		jumping to a tag: ":ta", CTRL-T, etc.
 		undo		undo or redo: "u" and CTRL-R
 	When a movement command is used for an operator (e.g., "dl" or "y%")
 	this option is not used.  This means the operator will include the
 	whole closed fold.
 	Note that vertical movements are not here, because it would make it
 	very difficult to move onto a closed fold.
 	In insert mode the folds containing the cursor will always be open
 	when text is inserted.
 	To close folds you can re-apply `'foldlevel'`  with the |zx| command or
 	set the `'foldclose'`  option to "all".

## fs


```lua
boolean
```

## fsync


```lua
boolean
```

 `'fsync'`  `'fs'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, the OS function fsync() will be called after saving a file
 	(|:write|, |writefile()|, …), |swap-file| and |shada-file|. This
 	flushes the file to disk, ensuring that it is safely written.

 `'guicursor'`  `'gcr'` 	string	(default "n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr-o:hor20")
 			global
 	Configures the cursor style for each mode. Works in the GUI and many
 	terminals.  See |tui-cursor-shape|.
 
 	To disable cursor-styling, reset the option: >
 		:set guicursor=
 
 <	To enable mode shapes, "Cursor" highlight, and blinking: >
 		:set guicursor=n-v-c:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr:hor20,o:hor50
 		  \,a:blinkwait700-blinkoff400-blinkon250-Cursor/lCursor
 		  \,sm:block-blinkwait175-blinkoff150-blinkon175
 
 <	The option is a comma-separated list of parts.  Each part consists of a
 	mode-list and an argument-list:
 		mode-list:argument-list,mode-list:argument-list,..
 	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes:
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		ve	Visual mode with `'selection'`  "exclusive" (same as `'v'` ,
 			if not specified)
 		o	Operator-pending mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		r	Replace mode
 		c	Command-line Normal (append) mode
 		ci	Command-line Insert mode
 		cr	Command-line Replace mode
 		sm	showmatch in Insert mode
 		a	all modes
 	The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
 		hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
 		ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
 		block	block cursor, fills the whole character
 			- Only one of the above three should be present.
 			- Default is "block" for each mode.
 		blinkwait{N}
 		blinkon{N}
 		blinkoff{N}
 			blink times for cursor: blinkwait is the delay before
 			the cursor starts blinking, blinkon is the time that
 			the cursor is shown and blinkoff is the time that the
 			cursor is not shown.  Times are in msec.  When one of
 			the numbers is zero, there is no blinking. E.g.: >
 				:set guicursor=n:blinkon0
 <			- Default is "blinkon0" for each mode.
 		{group-name}
 			Highlight group that decides the color and font of the
 			cursor.
 			In the |TUI|:
 			- |inverse|/reverse and no group-name are interpreted
 			  as "host-terminal default cursor colors" which
 			  typically means "inverted bg and fg colors".
 			- |ctermfg| and |guifg| are ignored.
 		{group-name}/{group-name}
 			Two highlight group names, the first is used when
 			no language mappings are used, the other when they
 			are. |language-mapping|
 
 	Examples of parts:
 	   n-c-v:block-nCursor	In Normal, Command-line and Visual mode, use a
 				block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
 				highlight group
 	   n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25-Cursor,r-cr-o:hor20
 				In Normal et al. modes, use a block cursor
 				with the default colors defined by the host
 				terminal.  In Insert-likes modes, use
 				a vertical bar cursor with colors from
 				"Cursor" highlight group.  In Replace-likes
 				modes, use a underline cursor with
 				default colors.
 	   i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
 				In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
 				30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
 				"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
 				faster.
 
 	The `'a'`  mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
 	all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
 	to do a common setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
 	blinking: "a:blinkon0"
 
 	Examples of cursor highlighting: >
 	    :highlight Cursor gui=reverse guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
 	    :highlight Cursor gui=NONE guifg=bg guibg=fg

## guifont


```lua
string
```

 `'guifont'`  `'gfn'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	This is a list of fonts which will be used for the GUI version of Vim.
 	In its simplest form the value is just one font name.  When
 	the font cannot be found you will get an error message.  To try other
 	font names a list can be specified, font names separated with commas.
 	The first valid font is used.
 
 	Spaces after a comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name
 	precede it with a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra
 	backslash before a space and a backslash.  See also
 	|option-backslash|.  For example: >
 	    :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
 <	will make Vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails it
 	will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.
 
 	If none of the fonts can be loaded, Vim will keep the current setting.
 	If an empty font list is given, Vim will try using other resource
 	settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
 	will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
 	the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
 	will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.
 
 	For Win32 and Mac OS: >
 	    :set guifont=*
 <	will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.
 
 	The font name depends on the GUI used.
 
 	For Mac OSX you can use something like this: >
 	    :set guifont=Monaco:h10
 <
 	Note that the fonts must be mono-spaced (all characters have the same
 	width).
 
 	To preview a font on X11, you might be able to use the "xfontsel"
 	program.  The "xlsfonts" program gives a list of all available fonts.
 
 	For the Win32 GUI
 	- takes these options in the font name:
 		hXX - height is XX (points, can be floating-point)
 		wXX - width is XX (points, can be floating-point)
 		b   - bold
 		i   - italic
 		u   - underline
 		s   - strikeout
 		cXX - character set XX.  Valid charsets are: ANSI, ARABIC,
 		      BALTIC, CHINESEBIG5, DEFAULT, EASTEUROPE, GB2312, GREEK,
 		      HANGEUL, HEBREW, JOHAB, MAC, OEM, RUSSIAN, SHIFTJIS,
 		      SYMBOL, THAI, TURKISH, VIETNAMESE ANSI and BALTIC.
 		      Normally you would use "cDEFAULT".
 
 	  Use a `':'`  to separate the options.
 	- A `'_'`  can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
 	  backslashes to escape the spaces.
 	- Examples: >
 	    :set guifont=courier_new:h12:w5:b:cRUSSIAN
 	    :set guifont=Andale_Mono:h7.5:w4.5
 <

## guifontwide


```lua
string
```

 `'guifontwide'`  `'gfw'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	Comma-separated list of fonts to be used for double-width characters.
 	The first font that can be loaded is used.
 	Note: The size of these fonts must be exactly twice as wide as the one
 	specified with `'guifont'`  and the same height.
 
 	When `'guifont'`  has a valid font and `'guifontwide'`  is empty Vim will
 	attempt to set `'guifontwide'`  to a matching double-width font.

## guioptions


```lua
string
```

 `'guioptions'`  `'go'` 	string	(default "egmrLT"   (MS-Windows))
 			global
 	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim.  It is a
 	sequence of letters which describes what components and options of the
 	GUI should be used.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
 
 	Valid letters are as follows:
 
 	  `'a'` 	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
 		or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
 		the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
 		Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
 		applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
 		ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
 		application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
 		is automatically yanked into the "* selection register.
 		Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
 		applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
 		    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
 		windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
 		by a yank or delete operation for the "* register.
 		The same applies to the modeless selection.
 
 	  `'P'` 	Like autoselect but using the "+ register instead of the "*
 		register.
 
 	  `'A'` 	Autoselect for the modeless selection.  Like `'a'` , but only
 		applies to the modeless selection.
 
 		    `'guioptions'`    autoselect Visual  autoselect modeless ~
 			 ""		 -			 -
 			 "a"		yes			yes
 			 "A"		 -			yes
 			 "aA"		yes			yes
 
 
 	  `'c'` 	Use console dialogs instead of popup dialogs for simple
 		choices.
 
 	  `'d'` 	Use dark theme variant if available.
 
 	  `'e'` 	Add tab pages when indicated with `'showtabline'` .
 		`'guitablabel'`  can be used to change the text in the labels.
 		When `'e'`  is missing a non-GUI tab pages line may be used.
 		The GUI tabs are only supported on some systems, currently
 		Mac OS/X and MS-Windows.
 
 	  `'i'` 	Use a Vim icon.
 
 	  `'m'` 	Menu bar is present.
 
 	  `'M'` 	The system menu "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim" is not sourced.  Note
 		that this flag must be added in the vimrc file, before
 		switching on syntax or filetype recognition (when the |gvimrc|
 		file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded; the
 		`:syntax on` and `:filetype on` commands load the menu too).
 
 	  `'g'` 	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
 		`'g'`  is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.
 
 	  `'T'` 	Include Toolbar.  Currently only in Win32 GUI.
 
 	  `'r'` 	Right-hand scrollbar is always present.
 
 	  `'R'` 	Right-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
 		split window.
 
 	  `'l'` 	Left-hand scrollbar is always present.
 
 	  `'L'` 	Left-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
 		split window.
 
 	  `'b'` 	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present.  Its size depends on
 		the longest visible line, or on the cursor line if the `'h'` 
 		flag is included. |gui-horiz-scroll|
 
 	  `'h'` 	Limit horizontal scrollbar size to the length of the cursor
 		line.  Reduces computations. |gui-horiz-scroll|
 
 	And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
 	you really want to :-).  See |gui-scrollbars| for more information.
 
 
 	  `'v'` 	Use a vertical button layout for dialogs.  When not included,
 		a horizontal layout is preferred, but when it doesn't fit a
 		vertical layout is used anyway.  Not supported in GTK 3.
 
 	  `'p'` 	Use Pointer callbacks for X11 GUI.  This is required for some
 		window managers.  If the cursor is not blinking or hollow at
 		the right moment, try adding this flag.  This must be done
 		before starting the GUI.  Set it in your |gvimrc|.  Adding or
 		removing it after the GUI has started has no effect.
 
 	  `'k'` 	Keep the GUI window size when adding/removing a scrollbar, or
 		toolbar, tabline, etc.  Instead, the behavior is similar to
 		when the window is maximized and will adjust `'lines'`  and
 		`'columns'`  to fit to the window.  Without the `'k'`  flag Vim will
 		try to keep `'lines'`  and `'columns'`  the same when adding and
 		removing GUI components.

## guitablabel


```lua
string
```

 `'guitablabel'`  `'gtl'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty describes the text to use in a label of the GUI tab
 	pages line.  When empty and when the result is empty Vim will use a
 	default label.  See |setting-guitablabel| for more info.
 
 	The format of this option is like that of `'statusline'` .
 	`'guitabtooltip'`  is used for the tooltip, see below.
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	Only used when the GUI tab pages line is displayed.  `'e'`  must be
 	present in `'guioptions'` .  For the non-GUI tab pages line `'tabline'`  is
 	used.

## guitabtooltip


```lua
string
```

 `'guitabtooltip'`  `'gtt'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty describes the text to use in a tooltip for the GUI tab
 	pages line.  When empty Vim will use a default tooltip.
 	This option is otherwise just like `'guitablabel'`  above.
 	You can include a line break.  Simplest method is to use |:let|: >
 		:let &guitabtooltip = "line one\nline two"
 <

## helpfile


```lua
string
```

 `'helpfile'`  `'hf'` 		string	(default (MS-Windows) "$VIMRUNTIME\doc\help.txt"
 					 (others) "$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt")
 			global
 	Name of the main help file.  All distributed help files should be
 	placed together in one directory.  Additionally, all "doc" directories
 	in `'runtimepath'`  will be used.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  For example:
 	"$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt".  If $VIMRUNTIME is not set, $VIM is also
 	tried.  Also see |$VIMRUNTIME| and |option-backslash| about including
 	spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## helpheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'helpheight'`  `'hh'` 	number	(default 20)
 			global
 	Minimal initial height of the help window when it is opened with the
 	":help" command.  The initial height of the help window is half of the
 	current window, or (when the `'ea'`  option is on) the same as other
 	windows.  When the height is less than `'helpheight'` , the height is
 	set to `'helpheight'` .  Set to zero to disable.

## helplang


```lua
string
```

 `'helplang'`  `'hlg'` 	string	(default: messages language or empty)
 			global
 	Comma-separated list of languages.  Vim will use the first language
 	for which the desired help can be found.  The English help will always
 	be used as a last resort.  You can add "en" to prefer English over
 	another language, but that will only find tags that exist in that
 	language and not in the English help.
 	Example: >
 		:set helplang=de,it
 <	This will first search German, then Italian and finally English help
 	files.
 	When using |CTRL-]| and ":help!" in a non-English help file Vim will
 	try to find the tag in the current language before using this option.
 	See |help-translated|.

## hf


```lua
string
```

## hh


```lua
integer
```

## hi


```lua
integer
```

## hid


```lua
boolean
```

## hidden


```lua
boolean
```

 `'hidden'`  `'hid'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When off a buffer is unloaded (including loss of undo information)
 	when it is |abandon|ed.  When on a buffer becomes hidden when it is
 	|abandon|ed.  A buffer displayed in another window does not become
 	hidden, of course.
 
 	Commands that move through the buffer list sometimes hide a buffer
 	although the `'hidden'`  option is off when these three are true:
 	- the buffer is modified
 	- `'autowrite'`  is off or writing is not possible
 	- the `'!'`  flag was used
 	Also see |windows|.
 
 	To hide a specific buffer use the `'bufhidden'`  option.
 	`'hidden'`  is set for one command with ":hide {command}" |:hide|.

## highlight


```lua
string
```

## history


```lua
integer
```

 `'history'`  `'hi'` 		number	(default: 10000)
 			global
 	A history of ":" commands, and a history of previous search patterns
 	is remembered.  This option decides how many entries may be stored in
 	each of these histories (see |cmdline-editing|).
 	The maximum value is 10000.

## hk


```lua
boolean
```

## hkmap


```lua
boolean
```

## hkmapp


```lua
boolean

## hkp


```lua
boolean
```

## hl


```lua
string
```

## hlg


```lua
string
```

## hls


```lua
boolean
```

## hlsearch


```lua
boolean
```

 `'hlsearch'`  `'hls'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches.
 	The |hl-Search| highlight group determines the highlighting for all
 	matches not under the cursor while the |hl-CurSearch| highlight group
 	(if defined) determines the highlighting for the match under the
 	cursor. If |hl-CurSearch| is not defined, then |hl-Search| is used for
 	both. Note that only the matching text is highlighted, any offsets
 	are not applied.
 	See also: `'incsearch'`  and |:match|.
 	When you get bored looking at the highlighted matches, you can turn it
 	off with |:nohlsearch|.  This does not change the option value, as
 	soon as you use a search command, the highlighting comes back.
 	`'redrawtime'`  specifies the maximum time spent on finding matches.
 	When the search pattern can match an end-of-line, Vim will try to
 	highlight all of the matched text.  However, this depends on where the
 	search starts.  This will be the first line in the window or the first
 	line below a closed fold.  A match in a previous line which is not
 	drawn may not continue in a newly drawn line.
 	You can specify whether the highlight status is restored on startup
 	with the `'h'`  flag in `'shada'`  |shada-h|.

## ic


```lua
boolean
```

## icm


```lua
string
```

## icon


```lua
boolean
```

 `'icon'` 			boolean	(default off, on when title can be restored)
 			global
 	When on, the icon text of the window will be set to the value of
 	`'iconstring'`  (if it is not empty), or to the name of the file
 	currently being edited.  Only the last part of the name is used.
 	Overridden by the `'iconstring'`  option.
 	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icons.

## iconstring


```lua
string
```

 `'iconstring'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the icon text of
 	the window.  This happens only when the `'icon'`  option is on.
 	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icon text
 	When this option contains printf-style `'%'`  items, they will be
 	expanded according to the rules used for `'statusline'` .  See
 	`'titlestring'`  for example settings.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.

## ignorecase


```lua
boolean
```

 `'ignorecase'`  `'ic'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Ignore case in search patterns.  Also used when searching in the tags
 	file.
 	Also see `'smartcase'`  and `'tagcase'` .
 	Can be overruled by using "\c" or "\C" in the pattern, see
 	|/ignorecase|.

## im


```lua
boolean
```

## imc


```lua
boolean
```

## imcmdline


```lua
boolean
```

 `'imcmdline'`  `'imc'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When set the Input Method is always on when starting to edit a command
 	line, unless entering a search pattern (see `'imsearch'`  for that).
 	Setting this option is useful when your input method allows entering
 	English characters directly, e.g., when it's used to type accented
 	characters with dead keys.

## imd


```lua
boolean
```

## imdisable


```lua
boolean
```

 `'imdisable'`  `'imd'` 	boolean (default off, on for some systems (SGI))
 			global
 	When set the Input Method is never used.  This is useful to disable
 	the IM when it doesn't work properly.
 	Currently this option is on by default for SGI/IRIX machines.  This
 	may change in later releases.

## inccommand


```lua
string
```

 `'inccommand'`  `'icm'` 	string	(default "nosplit")
 			global
 
 	When nonempty, shows the effects of |:substitute|, |:smagic|,
 	|:snomagic| and user commands with the |:command-preview| flag as you
 	type.
 
 	Possible values:
 		nosplit	Shows the effects of a command incrementally in the
 			buffer.
 		split	Like "nosplit", but also shows partial off-screen
 			results in a preview window.
 
 	If the preview for built-in commands is too slow (exceeds
 	`'redrawtime'` ) then `'inccommand'`  is automatically disabled until
 	|Command-line-mode| is done.

## incsearch


```lua
boolean
```

 `'incsearch'`  `'is'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed
 	so far, matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the pattern
 	is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will be updated
 	often, this is only useful on fast terminals.
 	Note that the match will be shown, but the cursor will return to its
 	original position when no match is found and when pressing <Esc>.  You
 	still need to finish the search command with <Enter> to move the
 	cursor to the match.
 	You can use the CTRL-G and CTRL-T keys to move to the next and
 	previous match. |c_CTRL-G| |c_CTRL-T|
 	Vim only searches for about half a second.  With a complicated
 	pattern and/or a lot of text the match may not be found.  This is to
 	avoid that Vim hangs while you are typing the pattern.
 	The |hl-IncSearch| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	When `'hlsearch'`  is on, all matched strings are highlighted too while
 	typing a search command. See also: `'hlsearch'` .
 	If you don't want to turn `'hlsearch'`  on, but want to highlight all
 	matches while searching, you can turn on and off `'hlsearch'`  with
 	autocmd.  Example: >
 		augroup vimrc-incsearch-highlight
 		  autocmd!
 		  autocmd CmdlineEnter /,\? :set hlsearch
 		  autocmd CmdlineLeave /,\? :set nohlsearch
 		augroup END
 <
 	CTRL-L can be used to add one character from after the current match
 	to the command line.  If `'ignorecase'`  and `'smartcase'`  are set and the
 	command line has no uppercase characters, the added character is
 	converted to lowercase.
 	CTRL-R CTRL-W can be used to add the word at the end of the current
 	match, excluding the characters that were already typed.

## insertmode


```lua
boolean
```

## is


```lua
boolean
```

## isf


```lua
string
```

## isfname


```lua
string
```

 `'isfname'`  `'isf'` 		string	(default for Windows:
 			     "@,48-57,/,\,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,{,},[,],:,@-@,!,~,="
 			    otherwise: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=")
 			global
 	The characters specified by this option are included in file names and
 	path names.  Filenames are used for commands like "gf", "[i" and in
 	the tags file.  It is also used for "\f" in a |pattern|.
 	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
 	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.
 	For UTF-8 the characters 0xa0 to 0xff are included as well.
 	Think twice before adding white space to this option.  Although a
 	space may appear inside a file name, the effect will be that Vim
 	doesn't know where a file name starts or ends when doing completion.
 	It most likely works better without a space in `'isfname'` .
 
 	Note that on systems using a backslash as path separator, Vim tries to
 	do its best to make it work as you would expect.  That is a bit
 	tricky, since Vi originally used the backslash to escape special
 	characters.  Vim will not remove a backslash in front of a normal file
 	name character on these systems, but it will on Unix and alikes.  The
 	`'&'`  and `'^'`  are not included by default, because these are special for
 	cmd.exe.
 
 	The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
 	Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
 	character numbers with `'-'`  in between.  A character number can be a
 	decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
 	not work for digits).  Example:
 		"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include `'_'`  and `'-'`  and the range
 					128 to 140 and `'#'`  to 43)
 	If a part starts with `'^'` , the following character number or range
 	will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
 	to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
 	included.  To include `'^'`  itself use it as the last character of the
 	option or the end of a range.  Example:
 		"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude `'a'`  to `'z'` , include `'#'`  and `'^'` )
 	If the character is `'@'` , all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
 	are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
 	plus accented characters.  To include `'@'`  itself use "@-@".  Examples:
 		"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
 				case ASCII letters.
 		"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the `'@'`  character.
 	A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
 	expected.  Example:
 		"48-57,,,_"	Digits, comma and underscore.
 	A comma can be excluded by prepending a `'^'` .  Example:
 		" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to `'~'` , excluding
 				comma, plus <Tab>.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

## isi


```lua
string
```

## isident


```lua
string
```

 `'isident'`  `'isi'` 		string	(default for Windows:
 					   "@,48-57,_,128-167,224-235"
 				otherwise: "@,48-57,_,192-255")
 			global
 	The characters given by this option are included in identifiers.
 	Identifiers are used in recognizing environment variables and after a
 	match of the `'define'`  option.  It is also used for "\i" in a
 	|pattern|.  See `'isfname'`  for a description of the format of this
 	option.  For `'@'`  only characters up to 255 are used.
 	Careful: If you change this option, it might break expanding
 	environment variables.  E.g., when `'/'`  is included and Vim tries to
 	expand "$HOME/.local/state/nvim/shada/main.shada".  Maybe you should
 	change `'iskeyword'`  instead.

## isp


```lua
string
```

## isprint


```lua
string
```

 `'isprint'`  `'isp'` 	string	(default: "@,161-255")
 			global
 	The characters given by this option are displayed directly on the
 	screen.  It is also used for "\p" in a |pattern|.  The characters from
 	space (ASCII 32) to `'~'`  (ASCII 126) are always displayed directly,
 	even when they are not included in `'isprint'`  or excluded.  See
 	`'isfname'`  for a description of the format of this option.
 
 	Non-printable characters are displayed with two characters:
 		  0 -  31	"^@" - "^_"
 		 32 - 126	always single characters
 		   127		"^?"
 		128 - 159	"~@" - "~_"
 		160 - 254	"| " - "|~"
 		   255		"~?"
 	Illegal bytes from 128 to 255 (invalid UTF-8) are
 	displayed as <xx>, with the hexadecimal value of the byte.
 	When `'display'`  contains "uhex" all unprintable characters are
 	displayed as <xx>.
 	The SpecialKey highlighting will be used for unprintable characters.
 	|hl-SpecialKey|
 
 	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
 	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.  When a character
 	is printable but it is not available in the current font, a
 	replacement character will be shown.
 	Unprintable and zero-width Unicode characters are displayed as <xxxx>.
 	There is no option to specify these characters.

## joinspaces


```lua
boolean
```

 `'joinspaces'`  `'js'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Insert two spaces after a `'.'` , `'?'`  and `'!'`  with a join command.
 	Otherwise only one space is inserted.

## jop


```lua
string
```

## js


```lua
boolean
```

## jumpoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'jumpoptions'`  `'jop'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	List of words that change the behavior of the |jumplist|.
 	  stack         Make the jumplist behave like the tagstack or like a
 	                web browser.  Relative location of entries in the
 			jumplist is preserved at the cost of discarding
 			subsequent entries when navigating backwards in the
 			jumplist and then jumping to a location.
 			|jumplist-stack|
 
 	  view          When moving through the jumplist, |changelist|,
 			|alternate-file| or using |mark-motions| try to
 			restore the |mark-view| in which the action occurred.

## keymodel


```lua
string
```

 `'keymodel'`  `'km'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	List of comma-separated words, which enable special things that keys
 	can do.  These values can be used:
 	   startsel	Using a shifted special key starts selection (either
 			Select mode or Visual mode, depending on "key" being
 			present in `'selectmode'` ).
 	   stopsel	Using a not-shifted special key stops selection.
 	Special keys in this context are the cursor keys, <End>, <Home>,
 	<PageUp> and <PageDown>.
 	The `'keymodel'`  option is set by the |:behave| command.

## km


```lua
string
```

## langmap


```lua
string
```

 `'langmap'`  `'lmap'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This option allows switching your keyboard into a special language
 	mode.  When you are typing text in Insert mode the characters are
 	inserted directly.  When in Normal mode the `'langmap'`  option takes
 	care of translating these special characters to the original meaning
 	of the key.  This means you don't have to change the keyboard mode to
 	be able to execute Normal mode commands.
 	This is the opposite of the `'keymap'`  option, where characters are
 	mapped in Insert mode.
 	Also consider setting `'langremap'`  to off, to prevent `'langmap'`  from
 	applying to characters resulting from a mapping.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.
 
 	Example (for Greek, in UTF-8):				  >
 	    :set langmap=ΑA,ΒB,ΨC,ΔD,ΕE,ΦF,ΓG,ΗH,ΙI,ΞJ,ΚK,ΛL,ΜM,ΝN,ΟO,ΠP,QQ,ΡR,ΣS,ΤT,ΘU,ΩV,WW,ΧX,ΥY,ΖZ,αa,βb,ψc,δd,εe,φf,γg,ηh,ιi,ξj,κk,λl,μm,νn,οo,πp,qq,ρr,σs,τt,θu,ωv,ςw,χx,υy,ζz
 <	Example (exchanges meaning of z and y for commands): >
 	    :set langmap=zy,yz,ZY,YZ
 <
 	The `'langmap'`  option is a list of parts, separated with commas.  Each
 	part can be in one of two forms:
 	1.  A list of pairs.  Each pair is a "from" character immediately
 	    followed by the "to" character.  Examples: "aA", "aAbBcC".
 	2.  A list of "from" characters, a semi-colon and a list of "to"
 	    characters.  Example: "abc;ABC"
 	Example: "aA,fgh;FGH,cCdDeE"
 	Special characters need to be preceded with a backslash.  These are
 	";", `','` , `'"'` , `'|'`  and backslash itself.
 
 	This will allow you to activate vim actions without having to switch
 	back and forth between the languages.  Your language characters will
 	be understood as normal vim English characters (according to the
 	langmap mappings) in the following cases:
 	 o Normal/Visual mode (commands, buffer/register names, user mappings)
 	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Register names after CTRL-R
 	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Mappings
 	Characters entered in Command-line mode will NOT be affected by
 	this option.   Note that this option can be changed at any time
 	allowing to switch between mappings for different languages/encodings.
 	Use a mapping to avoid having to type it each time!

## langmenu


```lua
string
```

 `'langmenu'`  `'lm'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	Language to use for menu translation.  Tells which file is loaded
 	from the "lang" directory in `'runtimepath'` : >
 		"lang/menu_" .. &langmenu .. ".vim"
 <	(without the spaces).  For example, to always use the Dutch menus, no
 	matter what $LANG is set to: >
 		:set langmenu=nl_NL.ISO_8859-1
 <	When `'langmenu'`  is empty, |v:lang| is used.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
 	If your $LANG is set to a non-English language but you do want to use
 	the English menus: >
 		:set langmenu=none
 <	This option must be set before loading menus, switching on filetype
 	detection or syntax highlighting.  Once the menus are defined setting
 	this option has no effect.  But you could do this: >
 		:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
 		:set langmenu=de_DE.ISO_8859-1
 		:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
 <	Warning: This deletes all menus that you defined yourself!

## langnoremap


```lua
boolean
```

## langremap


```lua
boolean
```

 `'langremap'`  `'lrm'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When off, setting `'langmap'`  does not apply to characters resulting from
 	a mapping.  If setting `'langmap'`  disables some of your mappings, make
 	sure this option is off.

## laststatus


```lua
integer
```

 `'laststatus'`  `'ls'` 	number	(default 2)
 			global
 	The value of this option influences when the last window will have a
 	status line:
 		0: never
 		1: only if there are at least two windows
 		2: always
 		3: always and ONLY the last window
 	The screen looks nicer with a status line if you have several
 	windows, but it takes another screen line. |status-line|

## lazyredraw


```lua
boolean
```

 `'lazyredraw'`  `'lz'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When this option is set, the screen will not be redrawn while
 	executing macros, registers and other commands that have not been
 	typed.  Also, updating the window title is postponed.  To force an
 	update use |:redraw|.
 	This may occasionally cause display errors.  It is only meant to be set
 	temporarily when performing an operation where redrawing may cause
 	flickering or cause a slow down.

## lines


```lua
integer
```

 `'lines'` 			number	(default 24 or terminal height)
 			global
 	Number of lines of the Vim window.
 	Normally you don't need to set this.  It is done automatically by the
 	terminal initialization code.
 	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
 	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
 	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |gvimrc| file.
 	Vim limits the number of lines to what fits on the screen.  You can
 	use this command to get the tallest window possible: >
 		:set lines=999
 <	Minimum value is 2, maximum value is 1000.

## linespace


```lua
integer
```

 `'linespace'`  `'lsp'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 			{only in the GUI}
 	Number of pixel lines inserted between characters.  Useful if the font
 	uses the full character cell height, making lines touch each other.
 	When non-zero there is room for underlining.
 	With some fonts there can be too much room between lines (to have
 	space for ascents and descents).  Then it makes sense to set
 	`'linespace'`  to a negative value.  This may cause display problems
 	though!

## lm

## magic


```lua
boolean
```

 `'magic'` 			boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Changes the special characters that can be used in search patterns.
 	See |pattern|.
 	WARNING: Switching this option off most likely breaks plugins!  That
 	is because many patterns assume it's on and will fail when it's off.
 	Only switch it off when working with old Vi scripts.  In any other
 	situation write patterns that work when `'magic'`  is on.  Include "\M"
 	when you want to |/\M|.

## makeef


```lua
string
```

 `'makeef'`  `'mef'` 		string	(default: "")
 			global
 	Name of the errorfile for the |:make| command (see |:make_makeprg|)
 	and the |:grep| command.
 	When it is empty, an internally generated temp file will be used.
 	When "##" is included, it is replaced by a number to make the name
 	unique.  This makes sure that the ":make" command doesn't overwrite an
 	existing file.
 	NOT used for the ":cf" command.  See `'errorfile'`  for that.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## mat


```lua
integer
```

## matchtime


```lua
integer
```

 `'matchtime'`  `'mat'` 	number	(default 5)
 			global
 	Tenths of a second to show the matching paren, when `'showmatch'`  is
 	set.  Note that this is not in milliseconds, like other options that
 	set a time.  This is to be compatible with Nvi.

## maxcombine


```lua
integer
```

## maxfuncdepth


```lua
integer
```

 `'maxfuncdepth'`  `'mfd'` 	number	(default 100)
 			global
 	Maximum depth of function calls for user functions.  This normally
 	catches endless recursion.  When using a recursive function with
 	more depth, set `'maxfuncdepth'`  to a bigger number.  But this will use
 	more memory, there is the danger of failing when memory is exhausted.
 	Increasing this limit above 200 also changes the maximum for Ex
 	command recursion, see |E169|.
 	See also |:function|.

## maxmapdepth


```lua
integer
```

 `'maxmapdepth'`  `'mmd'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global
 	Maximum number of times a mapping is done without resulting in a
 	character to be used.  This normally catches endless mappings, like
 	":map x y" with ":map y x".  It still does not catch ":map g wg",
 	because the `'w'`  is used before the next mapping is done.  See also
 	|key-mapping|.

## maxmempattern


```lua
integer
```

 `'maxmempattern'`  `'mmp'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global
 	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for pattern matching.
 	The maximum value is about 2000000.  Use this to work without a limit.
 
 	When Vim runs into the limit it gives an error message and mostly
 	behaves like CTRL-C was typed.
 	Running into the limit often means that the pattern is very
 	inefficient or too complex.  This may already happen with the pattern
 	"\(.\)*" on a very long line.  ".*" works much better.
 	Might also happen on redraw, when syntax rules try to match a complex
 	text structure.
 	Vim may run out of memory before hitting the `'maxmempattern'`  limit, in
 	which case you get an "Out of memory" error instead.

## mco


```lua
integer
```

## mef


```lua
string
```

## menuitems


```lua
integer
```

 `'menuitems'`  `'mis'` 	number	(default 25)
 			global
 	Maximum number of items to use in a menu.  Used for menus that are
 	generated from a list of items, e.g., the Buffers menu.  Changing this
 	option has no direct effect, the menu must be refreshed first.

## mfd


```lua
integer
```

## mh


```lua
boolean
```

## mis


```lua
integer
```

## mkspellmem


```lua
string
```

 `'mkspellmem'`  `'msm'` 	string	(default "460000,2000,500")
 			global
 	Parameters for |:mkspell|.  This tunes when to start compressing the
 	word tree.  Compression can be slow when there are many words, but
 	it's needed to avoid running out of memory.  The amount of memory used
 	per word depends very much on how similar the words are, that's why
 	this tuning is complicated.
 
 	There are three numbers, separated by commas:
 		{start},{inc},{added}
 
 	For most languages the uncompressed word tree fits in memory.  {start}
 	gives the amount of memory in Kbyte that can be used before any
 	compression is done.  It should be a bit smaller than the amount of
 	memory that is available to Vim.
 
 	When going over the {start} limit the {inc} number specifies the
 	amount of memory in Kbyte that can be allocated before another
 	compression is done.  A low number means compression is done after
 	less words are added, which is slow.  A high number means more memory
 	will be allocated.
 
 	After doing compression, {added} times 1024 words can be added before
 	the {inc} limit is ignored and compression is done when any extra
 	amount of memory is needed.  A low number means there is a smaller
 	chance of hitting the {inc} limit, less memory is used but it's
 	slower.
 
 	The languages for which these numbers are important are Italian and
 	Hungarian.  The default works for when you have about 512 Mbyte.  If
 	you have 1 Gbyte you could use: >
 		:set mkspellmem=900000,3000,800
 <	If you have less than 512 Mbyte |:mkspell| may fail for some
 	languages, no matter what you set `'mkspellmem'`  to.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|.

## modelineexpr


```lua
boolean
```

 `'modelineexpr'`  `'mle'` 	boolean (default: off)
 			global
 	When on allow some options that are an expression to be set in the
 	modeline.  Check the option for whether it is affected by
 	`'modelineexpr'` .  Also see |modeline|.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## modelines


```lua
integer
```

 `'modelines'`  `'mls'` 	number	(default 5)
 			global
 	If `'modeline'`  is on `'modelines'`  gives the number of lines that is
 	checked for set commands.  If `'modeline'`  is off or `'modelines'`  is zero
 	no lines are checked.  See |modeline|.

## more


```lua
boolean
```

 `'more'` 			boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	When on, listings pause when the whole screen is filled.  You will get
 	the |more-prompt|.  When this option is off there are no pauses, the
 	listing continues until finished.

## mouse


```lua
string
```

 `'mouse'` 			string	(default "nvi")
 			global
 
 	Enables mouse support. For example, to enable the mouse in Normal mode
 	and Visual mode: >
 		:set mouse=nv
 <
 	To temporarily disable mouse support, hold the shift key while using
 	the mouse.
 
 	Mouse support can be enabled for different modes:
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		c	Command-line mode
 		h	all previous modes when editing a help file
 		a	all previous modes
 		r	for |hit-enter| and |more-prompt| prompt
 
 	Left-click anywhere in a text buffer to place the cursor there.  This
 	works with operators too, e.g. type |d| then left-click to delete text
 	from the current cursor position to the position where you clicked.
 
 	Drag the |status-line| or vertical separator of a window to resize it.
 
 	If enabled for "v" (Visual mode) then double-click selects word-wise,
 	triple-click makes it line-wise, and quadruple-click makes it
 	rectangular block-wise.
 
 	For scrolling with a mouse wheel see |scroll-mouse-wheel|.
 
 	Note: When enabling the mouse in a terminal, copy/paste will use the
 	"* register if possible. See also `'clipboard'` .
 
 	Related options:
 	`'mousefocus'` 	window focus follows mouse pointer
 	`'mousemodel'` 	what mouse button does which action
 	`'mousehide'` 	hide mouse pointer while typing text
 	`'selectmode'` 	whether to start Select mode or Visual mode
 
 	The :behave command provides some "profiles" for mouse behavior.
 
 	:be[have] {model}	Set behavior for mouse and selection.  Valid
 				arguments are:
 				   mswin	MS-Windows behavior
 				   xterm	Xterm behavior
 
 				Using ":behave" changes these options:
 				option		mswin			xterm	~
 				`'selectmode'` 	"mouse,key"		""
 				`'mousemodel'` 	"popup"			"extend"
 				`'keymodel'` 	"startsel,stopsel"	""
 				`'selection'` 	"exclusive"		"inclusive"

## mousef


```lua
boolean
```

## mousefocus


```lua
boolean
```

 `'mousefocus'`  `'mousef'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	The window that the mouse pointer is on is automatically activated.
 	When changing the window layout or window focus in another way, the
 	mouse pointer is moved to the window with keyboard focus.  Off is the
 	default because it makes using the pull down menus a little goofy, as
 	a pointer transit may activate a window unintentionally.

## mousehide


```lua
boolean
```

 `'mousehide'`  `'mh'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 			{only works in the GUI}
 	When on, the mouse pointer is hidden when characters are typed.
 	The mouse pointer is restored when the mouse is moved.

## mousem


```lua
string
```

## mousemev


```lua
boolean
```

## mousemodel


```lua
string
```

 `'mousemodel'`  `'mousem'` 	string	(default "popup_setpos")
 			global
 	Sets the model to use for the mouse.  The name mostly specifies what
 	the right mouse button is used for:
 	   extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works
 			like in an xterm.
 	   popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
 			mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
 			with Microsoft Windows.
 	   popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the
 			position where the mouse was clicked, and thus the
 			selected operation will act upon the clicked object.
 			If clicking inside a selection, that selection will
 			be acted upon, i.e. no cursor move.  This implies of
 			course, that right clicking outside a selection will
 			end Visual mode.
 	Overview of what button does what for each model:
 	mouse		    extend		popup(_setpos) ~
 	left click	    place cursor	place cursor
 	left drag	    start selection	start selection
 	shift-left	    search word		extend selection
 	right click	    extend selection	popup menu (place cursor)
 	right drag	    extend selection	-
 	middle click	    paste		paste
 
 	In the "popup" model the right mouse button produces a pop-up menu.
 	Nvim creates a default |popup-menu| but you can redefine it.
 
 	Note that you can further refine the meaning of buttons with mappings.
 	See |mouse-overview|.  But mappings are NOT used for modeless selection.
 
 	Example: >
 	   :map <S-LeftMouse>     <RightMouse>
 	   :map <S-LeftDrag>      <RightDrag>
 	   :map <S-LeftRelease>   <RightRelease>
 	   :map <2-S-LeftMouse>   <2-RightMouse>
 	   :map <2-S-LeftDrag>    <2-RightDrag>
 	   :map <2-S-LeftRelease> <2-RightRelease>
 	   :map <3-S-LeftMouse>   <3-RightMouse>
 	   :map <3-S-LeftDrag>    <3-RightDrag>
 	   :map <3-S-LeftRelease> <3-RightRelease>
 	   :map <4-S-LeftMouse>   <4-RightMouse>
 	   :map <4-S-LeftDrag>    <4-RightDrag>
 	   :map <4-S-LeftRelease> <4-RightRelease>
 <
 	Mouse commands requiring the CTRL modifier can be simulated by typing
 	the "g" key before using the mouse:
 	    "g<LeftMouse>"  is "<C-LeftMouse>	(jump to tag under mouse click)
 	    "g<RightMouse>" is "<C-RightMouse>	("CTRL-T")
 
 	The `'mousemodel'`  option is set by the |:behave| command.

## mousemoveevent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'mousemoveevent'`  `'mousemev'`   boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, mouse move events are delivered to the input queue and are
 	available for mapping. The default, off, avoids the mouse movement
 	overhead except when needed.
 	Warning: Setting this option can make pending mappings to be aborted
 	when the mouse is moved.

## mouses


```lua
string
```

## mousescroll


```lua
string
```

 `'mousescroll'` 		string	(default "ver:3,hor:6")
 			global
 	This option controls the number of lines / columns to scroll by when
 	scrolling with a mouse. The option is a comma separated list of parts.
 	Each part consists of a direction and a count as follows:
 		direction:count,direction:count
 	Direction is one of either "hor" or "ver". "hor" controls horizontal
 	scrolling and "ver" controls vertical scrolling. Count sets the amount
 	to scroll by for the given direction, it should be a non negative
 	integer. Each direction should be set at most once. If a direction
 	is omitted, a default value is used (6 for horizontal scrolling and 3
 	for vertical scrolling). You can disable mouse scrolling by using
 	a count of 0.
 
 	Example: >
 		:set mousescroll=ver:5,hor:2
 <	Will make Nvim scroll 5 lines at a time when scrolling vertically, and
 	scroll 2 columns at a time when scrolling horizontally.

## mouseshape


```lua
string
```

 `'mouseshape'`  `'mouses'` 	string	(default "i:beam,r:beam,s:updown,sd:cross,
 					m:no,ml:up-arrow,v:rightup-arrow")
 			global
 	This option tells Vim what the mouse pointer should look like in
 	different modes.  The option is a comma-separated list of parts, much
 	like used for `'guicursor'` .  Each part consist of a mode/location-list
 	and an argument-list:
 		mode-list:shape,mode-list:shape,..
 	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes/locations:
 			In a normal window: ~
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		ve	Visual mode with `'selection'`  "exclusive" (same as `'v'` ,
 			if not specified)
 		o	Operator-pending mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		r	Replace mode
 
 			Others: ~
 		c	appending to the command-line
 		ci	inserting in the command-line
 		cr	replacing in the command-line
 		m	at the 'Hit ENTER' or `'More'`  prompts
 		ml	idem, but cursor in the last line
 		e	any mode, pointer below last window
 		s	any mode, pointer on a status line
 		sd	any mode, while dragging a status line
 		vs	any mode, pointer on a vertical separator line
 		vd	any mode, while dragging a vertical separator line
 		a	everywhere
 
 	The shape is one of the following:
 	avail	name		looks like ~
 	w x	arrow		Normal mouse pointer
 	w x	blank		no pointer at all (use with care!)
 	w x	beam		I-beam
 	w x	updown		up-down sizing arrows
 	w x	leftright	left-right sizing arrows
 	w x	busy		The system's usual busy pointer
 	w x	no		The system's usual "no input" pointer
 	  x	udsizing	indicates up-down resizing
 	  x	lrsizing	indicates left-right resizing
 	  x	crosshair	like a big thin +
 	  x	hand1		black hand
 	  x	hand2		white hand
 	  x	pencil		what you write with
 	  x	question	big ?
 	  x	rightup-arrow	arrow pointing right-up
 	w x	up-arrow	arrow pointing up
 	  x	<number>	any X11 pointer number (see X11/cursorfont.h)
 
 	The "avail" column contains a `'w'`  if the shape is available for Win32,
 	x for X11.
 	Any modes not specified or shapes not available use the normal mouse
 	pointer.
 
 	Example: >
 		:set mouseshape=s:udsizing,m:no
 <	will make the mouse turn to a sizing arrow over the status lines and
 	indicate no input when the hit-enter prompt is displayed (since
 	clicking the mouse has no effect in this state.)

## mouset


```lua
integer
```

## mousetime


```lua
integer
```

 `'mousetime'`  `'mouset'` 	number	(default 500)
 			global
 	Defines the maximum time in msec between two mouse clicks for the
 	second click to be recognized as a multi click.

## msm


```lua
string
```

## odev


```lua
boolean
```

## opendevice


```lua
boolean
```

 `'opendevice'`  `'odev'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 			{only for Windows}
 	Enable reading and writing from devices.  This may get Vim stuck on a
 	device that can be opened but doesn't actually do the I/O.  Therefore
 	it is off by default.
 	Note that on Windows editing "aux.h", "lpt1.txt" and the like also
 	result in editing a device.

## operatorfunc


```lua
string
```

 `'operatorfunc'`  `'opfunc'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			global
 	This option specifies a function to be called by the |g@| operator.
 	See |:map-operator| for more info and an example.  The value can be
 	the name of a function, a |lambda| or a |Funcref|. See
 	|option-value-function| for more information.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## opfunc


```lua
string
```

## packpath


```lua
unknown
```

## para


```lua
string
```

## paragraphs


```lua
string
```

 `'paragraphs'`  `'para'` 	string	(default "IPLPPPQPP TPHPLIPpLpItpplpipbp")
 			global
 	Specifies the nroff macros that separate paragraphs.  These are pairs
 	of two letters (see |object-motions|).

## paste


```lua
boolean
```

## pastetoggle


```lua
string
```

## patchexpr


```lua
string
```

 `'patchexpr'`  `'pex'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	Expression which is evaluated to apply a patch to a file and generate
 	the resulting new version of the file.  See |diff-patchexpr|.

## patchmode


```lua
string
```

 `'patchmode'`  `'pm'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	When non-empty the oldest version of a file is kept.  This can be used
 	to keep the original version of a file if you are changing files in a
 	source distribution.  Only the first time that a file is written a
 	copy of the original file will be kept.  The name of the copy is the
 	name of the original file with the string in the `'patchmode'`  option
 	appended.  This option should start with a dot.  Use a string like
 	".orig" or ".org".  `'backupdir'`  must not be empty for this to work
 	(Detail: The backup file is renamed to the patchmode file after the
 	new file has been successfully written, that's why it must be possible
 	to write a backup file).  If there was no file to be backed up, an
 	empty file is created.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a patchmode file is not made.
 	Using `'patchmode'`  for compressed files appends the extension at the
 	end (e.g., "file.gz.orig"), thus the resulting name isn't always
 	recognized as a compressed file.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

## pb

## previewheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'previewheight'`  `'pvh'` 	number (default 12)
 			global
 	Default height for a preview window.  Used for |:ptag| and associated
 	commands.  Used for |CTRL-W_}| when no count is given.

## prompt


```lua
boolean
```

## pt


```lua
string
```

## pumblend


```lua
integer
```

 `'pumblend'`  `'pb'` 		number	(default 0)
 			global
 	Enables pseudo-transparency for the |popup-menu|. Valid values are in
 	the range of 0 for fully opaque popupmenu (disabled) to 100 for fully
 	transparent background. Values between 0-30 are typically most useful.
 
 	It is possible to override the level for individual highlights within
 	the popupmenu using |highlight-blend|. For instance, to enable
 	transparency but force the current selected element to be fully opaque: >
 
 		:set pumblend=15
 		:hi PmenuSel blend=0
 <
 	UI-dependent. Works best with RGB colors. `'termguicolors'` 

## pumheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'pumheight'`  `'ph'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 	Maximum number of items to show in the popup menu
 	(|ins-completion-menu|). Zero means "use available screen space".

## pumwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'pumwidth'`  `'pw'` 		number	(default 15)
 			global
 	Minimum width for the popup menu (|ins-completion-menu|).  If the
 	cursor column + `'pumwidth'`  exceeds screen width, the popup menu is
 	nudged to fit on the screen.

## pvh


```lua
integer
```

## pw


```lua
integer
```

## pyx


```lua
integer
```

## pyxversion


```lua
integer
```

 `'pyxversion'`  `'pyx'` 	number	(default 3)
 			global
 	Specifies the python version used for pyx* functions and commands
 	|python_x|.  As only Python 3 is supported, this always has the value
 	`3`. Setting any other value is an error.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## qftf


```lua
string
```

## quickfixtextfunc


```lua
string
```

 `'quickfixtextfunc'`  `'qftf'` 	string (default "")
 			global
 	This option specifies a function to be used to get the text to display
 	in the quickfix and location list windows.  This can be used to
 	customize the information displayed in the quickfix or location window
 	for each entry in the corresponding quickfix or location list.  See
 	|quickfix-window-function| for an explanation of how to write the
 	function and an example.  The value can be the name of a function, a
 	|lambda| or a |Funcref|. See |option-value-function| for more
 	information.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## rdb


```lua
string
```

## rdt


```lua
integer
```

## re


```lua
integer
```

## redrawdebug


```lua
string
```

 `'redrawdebug'`  `'rdb'` 	string	(default `''` )
 			global
 	Flags to change the way redrawing works, for debugging purposes.
 	Most useful with `'writedelay'`  set to some reasonable value.
 	Supports the following flags:
 	    compositor	Indicate each redraw event handled by the compositor
 			by briefly flashing the redrawn regions in colors
 			indicating the redraw type. These are the highlight
 			groups used (and their default colors):
 		RedrawDebugNormal   gui=reverse   normal redraw passed through
 		RedrawDebugClear    guibg=Yellow  clear event passed through
 		RedrawDebugComposed guibg=Green   redraw event modified by the
 						  compositor (due to
 						  overlapping grids, etc)
 		RedrawDebugRecompose guibg=Red    redraw generated by the
 						  compositor itself, due to a
 						  grid being moved or deleted.
 	    line	introduce a delay after each line drawn on the screen.
 			When using the TUI or another single-grid UI, "compositor"
 			gives more information and should be preferred (every
 			line is processed as a separate event by the compositor)
 	    flush	introduce a delay after each "flush" event.
 	    nothrottle	Turn off throttling of the message grid. This is an
 			optimization that joins many small scrolls to one
 			larger scroll when drawing the message area (with
 			`'display'`  msgsep flag active).
 	    invalid	Enable stricter checking (abort) of inconsistencies
 			of the internal screen state. This is mostly
 			useful when running nvim inside a debugger (and
 			the test suite).
 	    nodelta	Send all internally redrawn cells to the UI, even if
 			they are unchanged from the already displayed state.

## redrawtime


```lua
integer
```

 `'redrawtime'`  `'rdt'` 	number	(default 2000)
 			global
 	Time in milliseconds for redrawing the display.  Applies to
 	`'hlsearch'` , `'inccommand'` , |:match| highlighting and syntax
 	highlighting.
 	When redrawing takes more than this many milliseconds no further
 	matches will be highlighted.
 	For syntax highlighting the time applies per window.  When over the
 	limit syntax highlighting is disabled until |CTRL-L| is used.
 	This is used to avoid that Vim hangs when using a very complicated
 	pattern.

## regexpengine


```lua
integer
```

 `'regexpengine'`  `'re'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 	This selects the default regexp engine. |two-engines|
 	The possible values are:
 		0	automatic selection
 		1	old engine
 		2	NFA engine
 	Note that when using the NFA engine and the pattern contains something
 	that is not supported the pattern will not match.  This is only useful
 	for debugging the regexp engine.
 	Using automatic selection enables Vim to switch the engine, if the
 	default engine becomes too costly.  E.g., when the NFA engine uses too
 	many states.  This should prevent Vim from hanging on a combination of
 	a complex pattern with long text.

## remap


```lua
boolean
```

## report


```lua
integer
```

 `'report'` 		number	(default 2)
 			global
 	Threshold for reporting number of lines changed.  When the number of
 	changed lines is more than `'report'`  a message will be given for most
 	":" commands.  If you want it always, set `'report'`  to 0.
 	For the ":substitute" command the number of substitutions is used
 	instead of the number of lines.

## revins


```lua
boolean
```

 `'revins'`  `'ri'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Inserting characters in Insert mode will work backwards.  See "typing
 	backwards" |ins-reverse|.  This option can be toggled with the CTRL-_
 	command in Insert mode, when `'allowrevins'`  is set.

## ri


```lua
boolean
```

## rtp


```lua
string
```

## ru


```lua
boolean
```

## ruf


```lua
string
```

## ruler


```lua
boolean
```

 `'ruler'`  `'ru'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Show the line and column number of the cursor position, separated by a
 	comma.  When there is room, the relative position of the displayed
 	text in the file is shown on the far right:
 		Top	first line is visible
 		Bot	last line is visible
 		All	first and last line are visible
 		45%	relative position in the file
 	If `'rulerformat'`  is set, it will determine the contents of the ruler.
 	Each window has its own ruler.  If a window has a status line, the
 	ruler is shown there.  If a window doesn't have a status line and
 	`'cmdheight'`  is zero, the ruler is not shown.  Otherwise it is shown in
 	the last line of the screen.  If the statusline is given by
 	`'statusline'`  (i.e. not empty), this option takes precedence over
 	`'ruler'`  and `'rulerformat'` .
 	If the number of characters displayed is different from the number of
 	bytes in the text (e.g., for a TAB or a multibyte character), both
 	the text column (byte number) and the screen column are shown,
 	separated with a dash.
 	For an empty line "0-1" is shown.
 	For an empty buffer the line number will also be zero: "0,0-1".
 	If you don't want to see the ruler all the time but want to know where
 	you are, use "g CTRL-G" |g_CTRL-G|.

## rulerformat


```lua
string
```

 `'rulerformat'`  `'ruf'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When this option is not empty, it determines the content of the ruler
 	string, as displayed for the `'ruler'`  option.
 	The format of this option is like that of `'statusline'` .
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	The default ruler width is 17 characters.  To make the ruler 15
 	characters wide, put "%15(" at the start and "%)" at the end.
 	Example: >
 		:set rulerformat=%15(%c%V\ %p%%%)
 <

## runtimepath


```lua
string
```

 `'runtimepath'`  `'rtp'` 	string	(default:     "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim,
 					       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS[1]/nvim,
 					       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS[2]/nvim,
 					       …

 					       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS[1]/nvim/after,
 					       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/after")
 			global
 	List of directories to be searched for these runtime files:
 	  filetype.lua	filetypes |new-filetype|
 	  autoload/	automatically loaded scripts |autoload-functions|
 	  colors/	color scheme files |:colorscheme|
 	  compiler/	compiler files |:compiler|
 	  doc/		documentation |write-local-help|

 	  indent/	indent scripts |indent-expression|
 	  keymap/	key mapping files |mbyte-keymap|
 	  lang/		menu translations |:menutrans|
 	  lua/		|Lua| plugins
 	  menu.vim	GUI menus |menu.vim|
 	  pack/		packages |:packadd|
 	  parser/	|treesitter| syntax parsers
 	  plugin/	plugin scripts |write-plugin|
 	  query/	|treesitter| queries
 	  rplugin/	|remote-plugin| scripts
 	  spell/	spell checking files |spell|
 	  syntax/	syntax files |mysyntaxfile|
 	  tutor/	tutorial files |:Tutor|
 
 	And any other file searched for with the |:runtime| command.
 
 	Defaults are setup to search these locations:
 	1. Your home directory, for personal preferences.
 	   Given by `stdpath("config")`.  |$XDG_CONFIG_HOME|
 	2. Directories which must contain configuration files according to
 	   |xdg| ($XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, defaults to /etc/xdg).  This also contains
 	   preferences from system administrator.
 	3. Data home directory, for plugins installed by user.
 	   Given by `stdpath("data")/site`.  |$XDG_DATA_HOME|
 	4. nvim/site subdirectories for each directory in $XDG_DATA_DIRS.
 	   This is for plugins which were installed by system administrator,
 	   but are not part of the Nvim distribution. XDG_DATA_DIRS defaults
 	   to /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/, so system administrators are
 	   expected to install site plugins to /usr/share/nvim/site.
 	5. Session state directory, for state data such as swap, backupdir,
 	   viewdir, undodir, etc.
 	   Given by `stdpath("state")`.  |$XDG_STATE_HOME|
 	6. $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Nvim.
 
 	7, 8, 9, 10. In after/ subdirectories of 1, 2, 3 and 4, with reverse
 	   ordering.  This is for preferences to overrule or add to the
 	   distributed defaults or system-wide settings (rarely needed).
 
 
 	"start" packages will also be searched (|runtime-search-path|) for
 	runtime files after these, though such packages are not explicitly
 	reported in &runtimepath. But "opt" packages are explicitly added to
 	&runtimepath by |:packadd|.
 
 	Note that, unlike `'path'` , no wildcards like "" are allowed.  Normal
 	wildcards are allowed, but can significantly slow down searching for
 	runtime files.  For speed, use as few items as possible and avoid
 	wildcards.
 	See |:runtime|.
 	Example: >
 		:set runtimepath=~/vimruntime,/mygroup/vim,$VIMRUNTIME
 <	This will use the directory "~/vimruntime" first (containing your
 	personal Nvim runtime files), then "/mygroup/vim", and finally
 	"$VIMRUNTIME" (the default runtime files).
 	You can put a directory before $VIMRUNTIME to find files which replace
 	distributed runtime files.  You can put a directory after $VIMRUNTIME
 	to find files which add to distributed runtime files.
 
 	With |--clean| the home directory entries are not included.

## sb


```lua
boolean

## sbo


```lua
string
```

## sc


```lua
boolean
```

## scrolljump


```lua
integer
```

 `'scrolljump'`  `'sj'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	Minimal number of lines to scroll when the cursor gets off the
 	screen (e.g., with "j").  Not used for scroll commands (e.g., CTRL-E,
 	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.
 	When set to a negative number from -1 to -100 this is used as the
 	percentage of the window height.  Thus -50 scrolls half the window
 	height.

## scrollopt


```lua
string
```

 `'scrollopt'`  `'sbo'` 	string	(default "ver,jump")
 			global
 	This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
 	`'scrollbind'`  windows should behave.  `'sbo'`  stands for ScrollBind
 	Options.
 	The following words are available:
 	    ver		Bind vertical scrolling for `'scrollbind'`  windows
 	    hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for `'scrollbind'`  windows
 	    jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
 			scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
 			displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
 			around in a window, another `'scrollbind'`  window may
 			reach a position before the start or after the end of
 			the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
 			moving back the `'scrollbind'`  window will try to scroll
 			to the desired position when possible.
 			When now making that window the current one, two
 			things can be done with the relative offset:
 			1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
 			   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
 			   window.  When going back to the other window, the
 			   new relative offset will be used.
 			2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
 			   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
 			   going back to the other window, it still uses the
 			   same relative offset.
 	Also see |scroll-binding|.
 	When `'diff'`  mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
 	even when "ver" isn't there.

## scs

## sections


```lua
string
```

 `'sections'`  `'sect'` 	string	(default "SHNHH HUnhsh")
 			global
 	Specifies the nroff macros that separate sections.  These are pairs of
 	two letters (See |object-motions|).  The default makes a section start
 	at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

## secure


```lua
boolean
```

## sel


```lua
string
```

## selection


```lua
string
```

 `'selection'`  `'sel'` 	string	(default "inclusive")
 			global
 	This option defines the behavior of the selection.  It is only used
 	in Visual and Select mode.
 	Possible values:
 	   value	past line     inclusive ~
 	   old		   no		yes
 	   inclusive	   yes		yes
 	   exclusive	   yes		no
 	"past line" means that the cursor is allowed to be positioned one
 	character past the line.
 	"inclusive" means that the last character of the selection is included
 	in an operation.  For example, when "x" is used to delete the
 	selection.
 	When "old" is used and `'virtualedit'`  allows the cursor to move past
 	the end of line the line break still isn't included.
 	Note that when "exclusive" is used and selecting from the end
 	backwards, you cannot include the last character of a line, when
 	starting in Normal mode and `'virtualedit'`  empty.
 
 	The `'selection'`  option is set by the |:behave| command.

## selectmode


```lua
string
```

 `'selectmode'`  `'slm'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This is a comma-separated list of words, which specifies when to start
 	Select mode instead of Visual mode, when a selection is started.
 	Possible values:
 	   mouse	when using the mouse
 	   key		when using shifted special keys
 	   cmd		when using "v", "V" or CTRL-V
 	See |Select-mode|.
 	The `'selectmode'`  option is set by the |:behave| command.

## sessionoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'sessionoptions'`  `'ssop'` 	string	(default: "blank,buffers,curdir,folds,
 					       help,tabpages,winsize,terminal")
 			global
 	Changes the effect of the |:mksession| command.  It is a comma-
 	separated list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring
 	something:
 	   word		save and restore ~
 	   blank	empty windows
 	   buffers	hidden and unloaded buffers, not just those in windows
 	   curdir	the current directory
 	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
 			fold options
 	   globals	global variables that start with an uppercase letter
 			and contain at least one lowercase letter.  Only
 			String and Number types are stored.
 	   help		the help window
 	   localoptions	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
 			global values for local options)
 	   options	all options and mappings (also global values for local
 			options)
 	   skiprtp	exclude `'runtimepath'`  and `'packpath'`  from the options
 	   resize	size of the Vim window: `'lines'`  and `'columns'` 
 	   sesdir	the directory in which the session file is located
 			will become the current directory (useful with
 			projects accessed over a network from different
 			systems)
 	   tabpages	all tab pages; without this only the current tab page
 			is restored, so that you can make a session for each
 			tab page separately
 	   terminal	include terminal windows where the command can be
 			restored
 	   winpos	position of the whole Vim window

## shada


```lua
string
```

 `'shada'`  `'sd'` 		string	(default for
 				   Win32:  !,'100,<50,s10,h,rA:,rB:
 				   others: !,'100,<50,s10,h)
 			global
 	When non-empty, the shada file is read upon startup and written
 	when exiting Vim (see |shada-file|).  The string should be a comma-
 	separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
 	identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
 	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
 	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
 	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
 	the effect of their value.
 	CHAR	VALUE	~
 
 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
 
 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
 		the `'<'`  item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
 		start of a comment!
 
 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
 		(`'buftype'` ), unlisted (`'buflisted'` ), unnamed and buffers on
 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
 		buffers are stored.
 
 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
 		`'shada'`  is non-empty.
 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
 
 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
 		`'history'`  is used.
 
 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
 		saved.  When not included, the value of `'history'`  is used.
 
 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
 		saved.  `'"'`  is the old name for this item.
 		Also see the `'s'`  item below: limit specified in KiB.
 
 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
 		saved.  When not included, the value of `'history'`  is used.
 
 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and `'encoding'`  value is fixed
 		to UTF-8 as well.
 
 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
 
 	h	Disable the effect of `'hlsearch'`  when loading the shada
 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
 		has been used since the last search command.
 
 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
 		the `'n'` .  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
 		`'shadafile'`  option is set, that file name overrides the one
 		given here with `'shada'` .  Environment variables are
 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
 
 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
 		`','` ).  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
 
 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.
 
 	Example: >
 	    :set shada='50,<1000,s100,:0,n~/nvim/shada
 <
 	'50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
 			edited.
 	<1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
 			remembered.
 	s100		Items with contents occupying more then 100 KiB are
 			skipped.
 	:0		Command-line history will not be saved.
 	n~/nvim/shada	The name of the file to use is "~/nvim/shada".
 	no /		Since `'/'`  is not specified, the default will be used,
 			that is, save all of the search history, and also the
 			previous search and substitute patterns.
 	no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
 	no h		`'hlsearch'`  highlighting will be restored.
 
 	When setting `'shada'`  from an empty value you can use |:rshada| to
 	load the contents of the file, this is not done automatically.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shadafile


```lua
string
```

 `'shadafile'`  `'sdf'` 	string	(default: "")
 			global
 	When non-empty, overrides the file name used for |shada| (viminfo).
 	When equal to "NONE" no shada file will be read or written.
 	This option can be set with the |-i| command line flag.  The |--clean|
 	command line flag sets it to "NONE".
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shcf


```lua
string
```

## shell


```lua
string
```

 `'shell'`  `'sh'` 		string	(default $SHELL or "sh", Win32: "cmd.exe")
 			global
 	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
 	value also check these options: `'shellpipe'` , `'shellslash'` 
 	`'shellredir'` , `'shellquote'` , `'shellxquote'`  and `'shellcmdflag'` .
 	It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 
 	If the name of the shell contains a space, you need to enclose it in
 	quotes.  Example with quotes: >
 		:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f
 <	Note the backslash before each quote (to avoid starting a comment) and
 	each space (to avoid ending the option value), so better use |:let-&|
 	like this: >
 		:let &shell='"C:\Program Files\unix\sh.exe" -f'
 <	Also note that the "-f" is not inside the quotes, because it is not
 	part of the command name.
 
 	Rules regarding quotes:
 	1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside
 	   quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument
 	   "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
 	   arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
 	   `'shellcmdflag'` ”).
 	2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
 	   `'"abc"'` , `'"a"bc'` , `'a"b"c'` , `'ab"c"'`  and `'"a"b"c"'`  are all equivalent
 	   to just "abc".
 	3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.
 	   Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding
 	   anything else means backslash and next character literally:
 	   `'"a\\b"'`  is the same as "a\b", `'"a\\"b"'`  runs shell named literally
 	   `'a"b'` , `'"a\b"'`  is the same as "a\b" again.
 	4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used
 	   to escape quote: `'a\"b"'`  is the same as "a\b".
 	Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of
 	unescaping, so to keep yourself sane use |:let-&| like shown above.
 
 	To use PowerShell: >
 		let &shell = executable(`'pwsh'` ) ? `'pwsh'`  : `'powershell'` 
 		let &shellcmdflag = '-NoLogo -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Command [Console]::InputEncoding=[Console]::OutputEncoding=[System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new();$PSDefaultParameterValues[`''` Out-File:Encoding`''` ]=`''` utf8`''` ;'
 		let &shellredir = '2>&1 | %%{ "$_" } | Out-File %s; exit $LastExitCode'
 		let &shellpipe  = '2>&1 | %%{ "$_" } | Tee-Object %s; exit $LastExitCode'
 		set shellquote= shellxquote=
 
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shellcmdflag


```lua
string
```

 `'shellcmdflag'`  `'shcf'` 	string	(default: "-c"; Windows: "/s /c")
 			global
 	Flag passed to the shell to execute "!" and ":!" commands; e.g.,
 	`bash.exe -c ls` or `cmd.exe /s /c "dir"`.  For MS-Windows, the
 	default is set according to the value of `'shell'` , to reduce the need
 	to set this option by the user.
 	On Unix it can have more than one flag.  Each white space separated
 	part is passed as an argument to the shell command.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	See |shell-unquoting| which talks about separating this option into
 	multiple arguments.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shellpipe


```lua
string
```

 `'shellpipe'`  `'sp'` 	string	(default ">", "| tee", "|& tee" or "2>&1| tee")
 			global
 	String to be used to put the output of the ":make" command in the
 	error file.  See also |:make_makeprg|.  See |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes.
 	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
 	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
 	of this option).
 	For MS-Windows the default is "2>&1| tee".  The stdout and stderr are
 	saved in a file and echoed to the screen.
 	For Unix the default is "| tee".  The stdout of the compiler is saved
 	in a file and echoed to the screen.  If the `'shell'`  option is "csh" or
 	"tcsh" after initializations, the default becomes "|& tee".  If the
 	`'shell'`  option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh", "zsh-beta",
 	"bash", "fish", "ash" or "dash" the default becomes "2>&1| tee".  This
 	means that stderr is also included.  Before using the `'shell'`  option a
 	path is removed, thus "/bin/sh" uses "sh".
 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
 	and the other initializations, so that when the `'shell'`  option is set
 	there, the `'shellpipe'`  option changes automatically, unless it was
 	explicitly set before.
 	When `'shellpipe'`  is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
 	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a `'makeprg'` 
 	that writes to `'makeef'`  by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
 	want to include the `'makeef'` , set `'shellpipe'`  to a single space.
 	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
 	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
 	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shellquote


```lua
string
```

 `'shellquote'`  `'shq'` 	string	(default: ""; Windows, when `'shell'` 
 					contains "sh" somewhere: "\"")
 			global
 	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
 	the "!" and ":!" commands.  The redirection is kept outside of the
 	quoting.  See `'shellxquote'`  to include the redirection.  It's
 	probably not useful to set both options.
 	This is an empty string by default.  Only known to be useful for
 	third-party shells on Windows systems, such as the MKS Korn Shell
 	or bash, where it should be "\"".  The default is adjusted according
 	the value of `'shell'` , to reduce the need to set this option by the
 	user.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shellredir


```lua
string
```

 `'shellredir'`  `'srr'` 	string	(default ">", ">&" or ">%s 2>&1")
 			global
 	String to be used to put the output of a filter command in a temporary
 	file.  See also |:!|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces
 	and backslashes.
 	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
 	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
 	of this option).
 	The default is ">".  For Unix, if the `'shell'`  option is "csh" or
 	"tcsh" during initializations, the default becomes ">&".  If the
 	`'shell'`  option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh", "zsh-beta",
 	"bash" or "fish", the default becomes ">%s 2>&1".  This means that
 	stderr is also included.  For Win32, the Unix checks are done and
 	additionally "cmd" is checked for, which makes the default ">%s 2>&1".
 	Also, the same names with ".exe" appended are checked for.
 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
 	and the other initializations, so that when the `'shell'`  option is set
 	there, the `'shellredir'`  option changes automatically unless it was
 	explicitly set before.
 	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
 	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shellslash


```lua
boolean
```

 `'shellslash'`  `'ssl'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 			{only for MS-Windows}
 	When set, a forward slash is used when expanding file names.  This is
 	useful when a Unix-like shell is used instead of cmd.exe.  Backward
 	slashes can still be typed, but they are changed to forward slashes by
 	Vim.
 	Note that setting or resetting this option has no effect for some
 	existing file names, thus this option needs to be set before opening
 	any file for best results.  This might change in the future.
 	`'shellslash'`  only works when a backslash can be used as a path
 	separator.  To test if this is so use: >
 		if exists(`'+shellslash'` )
 <	Also see `'completeslash'` .

## shelltemp


```lua
boolean
```

 `'shelltemp'`  `'stmp'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, use temp files for shell commands.  When off use a pipe.
 	When using a pipe is not possible temp files are used anyway.
 	The advantage of using a pipe is that nobody can read the temp file
 	and the `'shell'`  command does not need to support redirection.
 	The advantage of using a temp file is that the file type and encoding
 	can be detected.
 	The |FilterReadPre|, |FilterReadPost| and |FilterWritePre|,
 	|FilterWritePost| autocommands event are not triggered when
 	`'shelltemp'`  is off.
 	|system()| does not respect this option, it always uses pipes.

## shellxescape


```lua
string
```

 `'shellxescape'`  `'sxe'` 	string	(default: "")
 			global
 	When `'shellxquote'`  is set to "(" then the characters listed in this
 	option will be escaped with a `'^'`  character.  This makes it possible
 	to execute most external commands with cmd.exe.

## shellxquote


```lua
string
```

 `'shellxquote'`  `'sxq'` 	string	(default: "", Windows: "\"")
 			global
 	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
 	the "!" and ":!" commands.  Includes the redirection.  See
 	`'shellquote'`  to exclude the redirection.  It's probably not useful
 	to set both options.
 	When the value is `'('`  then `')'`  is appended. When the value is `'"('` 
 	then `')"'`  is appended.
 	When the value is `'('`  then also see `'shellxescape'` .
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shiftround


```lua
boolean
```

 `'shiftround'`  `'sr'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Round indent to multiple of `'shiftwidth'` .  Applies to > and <
 	commands.  CTRL-T and CTRL-D in Insert mode always round the indent to
 	a multiple of `'shiftwidth'`  (this is Vi compatible).

## shm


```lua
string
```

## shortmess


```lua
string
```

 `'shortmess'`  `'shm'` 	string	(default "filnxtToOF")
 			global
 	This option helps to avoid all the |hit-enter| prompts caused by file
 	messages, for example  with CTRL-G, and to avoid some other messages.
 	It is a list of flags:
 	 flag	meaning when present	~
 	  f	use "(3 of 5)" instead of "(file 3 of 5)"
 	  i	use "[noeol]" instead of "[Incomplete last line]"
 	  l	use "999L, 888B" instead of "999 lines, 888 bytes"
 	  m	use "[+]" instead of "[Modified]"
 	  n	use "[New]" instead of "[New File]"
 	  r	use "[RO]" instead of "[readonly]"
 	  w	use "[w]" instead of "written" for file write message
 		and "[a]" instead of "appended" for ':w >> file' command
 	  x	use "[dos]" instead of "[dos format]", "[unix]"
 		instead of "[unix format]" and "[mac]" instead of "[mac
 		format]"
 	  a	all of the above abbreviations
 
 	  o	overwrite message for writing a file with subsequent
 		message for reading a file (useful for ":wn" or when
 		`'autowrite'`  on)
 	  O	message for reading a file overwrites any previous
 		message;  also for quickfix message (e.g., ":cn")
 	  s	don't give "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP" or
 		"search hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages; when using
 		the search count do not show "W" after the count message (see
 		S below)
 	  t	truncate file message at the start if it is too long
 		to fit on the command-line, "<" will appear in the left most
 		column; ignored in Ex mode
 	  T	truncate other messages in the middle if they are too
 		long to fit on the command line; "..." will appear in the
 		middle; ignored in Ex mode
 	  W	don't give "written" or "[w]" when writing a file
 	  A	don't give the "ATTENTION" message when an existing
 		swap file is found
 	  I	don't give the intro message when starting Vim,
 		see |:intro|
 	  c	don't give |ins-completion-menu| messages; for
 		example, "-- XXX completion (YYY)", "match 1 of 2", "The only
 		match", "Pattern not found", "Back at original", etc.
 	  C	don't give messages while scanning for ins-completion
 		items, for instance "scanning tags"
 	  q	use "recording" instead of "recording @a"
 	  F	don't give the file info when editing a file, like
 		`:silent` was used for the command
 	  S	do not show search count message when searching, e.g.
 		"[1/5]"
 
 	This gives you the opportunity to avoid that a change between buffers
 	requires you to hit <Enter>, but still gives as useful a message as
 	possible for the space available.  To get the whole message that you
 	would have got with `'shm'`  empty, use ":file!"
 	Useful values:
 	    shm=	No abbreviation of message.
 	    shm=a	Abbreviation, but no loss of information.
 	    shm=at	Abbreviation, and truncate message when necessary.

## showcmd


```lua
boolean
```

 `'showcmd'`  `'sc'` 		boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	Show (partial) command in the last line of the screen.  Set this
 	option off if your terminal is slow.
 	In Visual mode the size of the selected area is shown:
 	- When selecting characters within a line, the number of characters.
 	  If the number of bytes is different it is also displayed: "2-6"
 	  means two characters and six bytes.
 	- When selecting more than one line, the number of lines.
 	- When selecting a block, the size in screen characters:
 	  {lines}x{columns}.
 	This information can be displayed in an alternative location using the
 	`'showcmdloc'`  option, useful when `'cmdheight'`  is 0.

## showcmdloc


```lua
string
```

 `'showcmdloc'`  `'sloc'` 	string	(default "last")
 			global
 	This option can be used to display the (partially) entered command in
 	another location.  Possible values are:
 	  last		Last line of the screen (default).
 	  statusline	Status line of the current window.
 	  tabline	First line of the screen if `'showtabline'`  is enabled.
 	Setting this option to "statusline" or "tabline" means that these will
 	be redrawn whenever the command changes, which can be on every key
 	pressed.
 	The %S `'statusline'`  item can be used in `'statusline'`  or `'tabline'`  to
 	place the text.  Without a custom `'statusline'`  or `'tabline'`  it will be
 	displayed in a convenient location.

## showfulltag


```lua
boolean
```

 `'showfulltag'`  `'sft'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When completing a word in insert mode (see |ins-completion|) from the
 	tags file, show both the tag name and a tidied-up form of the search
 	pattern (if there is one) as possible matches.  Thus, if you have
 	matched a C function, you can see a template for what arguments are
 	required (coding style permitting).
 	Note that this doesn't work well together with having "longest" in
 	`'completeopt'` , because the completion from the search pattern may not
 	match the typed text.

## showmatch


```lua
boolean
```

 `'showmatch'`  `'sm'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When a bracket is inserted, briefly jump to the matching one.  The
 	jump is only done if the match can be seen on the screen.  The time to
 	show the match can be set with `'matchtime'` .
 	A Beep is given if there is no match (no matter if the match can be
 	seen or not).
 	When the `'m'`  flag is not included in `'cpoptions'` , typing a character
 	will immediately move the cursor back to where it belongs.
 	See the "sm" field in `'guicursor'`  for setting the cursor shape and
 	blinking when showing the match.
 	The `'matchpairs'`  option can be used to specify the characters to show
 	matches for.  `'rightleft'`  and `'revins'`  are used to look for opposite
 	matches.
 	Also see the matchparen plugin for highlighting the match when moving
 	around |pi_paren.txt|.
 	Note: Use of the short form is rated PG.

## showmode


```lua
boolean
```

 `'showmode'`  `'smd'` 	boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	If in Insert, Replace or Visual mode put a message on the last line.
 	The |hl-ModeMsg| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	The option has no effect when `'cmdheight'`  is zero.

## showtabline


```lua
integer
```

 `'showtabline'`  `'stal'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The value of this option specifies when the line with tab page labels
 	will be displayed:
 		0: never
 		1: only if there are at least two tab pages
 		2: always
 	This is both for the GUI and non-GUI implementation of the tab pages
 	line.
 	See |tab-page| for more information about tab pages.

## shq


```lua
string
```

## sidescroll


```lua
integer
```

 `'sidescroll'`  `'ss'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The minimal number of columns to scroll horizontally.  Used only when
 	the `'wrap'`  option is off and the cursor is moved off of the screen.
 	When it is zero the cursor will be put in the middle of the screen.
 	When using a slow terminal set it to a large number or 0.  Not used
 	for "zh" and "zl" commands.

## sj


```lua
integer
```

## slm


```lua
string
```

## sloc


```lua
string
```

## sm


```lua
boolean
```

## smartcase


```lua
boolean
```

 `'smartcase'`  `'scs'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Override the `'ignorecase'`  option if the search pattern contains upper
 	case characters.  Only used when the search pattern is typed and
 	`'ignorecase'`  option is on.  Used for the commands "/", "?", "n", "N",
 	":g" and ":s".  Not used for "*", "#", "gd", tag search, etc.  After
 	"*" and "#" you can make `'smartcase'`  used by doing a "/" command,
 	recalling the search pattern from history and hitting <Enter>.

## smarttab


```lua
boolean
```

 `'smarttab'`  `'sta'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, a <Tab> in front of a line inserts blanks according to
 	`'shiftwidth'` .  `'tabstop'`  or `'softtabstop'`  is used in other places.  A
 	<BS> will delete a `'shiftwidth'`  worth of space at the start of the
 	line.
 	When off, a <Tab> always inserts blanks according to `'tabstop'`  or
 	`'softtabstop'` .  `'shiftwidth'`  is only used for shifting text left or
 	right |shift-left-right|.
 	What gets inserted (a <Tab> or spaces) depends on the `'expandtab'` 
 	option.  Also see |ins-expandtab|.  When `'expandtab'`  is not set, the
 	number of spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.

## spellsuggest


```lua
string
```

 `'spellsuggest'`  `'sps'` 	string	(default "best")
 			global
 	Methods used for spelling suggestions.  Both for the |z=| command and
 	the |spellsuggest()| function.  This is a comma-separated list of
 	items:
 
 	best		Internal method that works best for English.  Finds
 			changes like "fast" and uses a bit of sound-a-like
 			scoring to improve the ordering.
 
 	double		Internal method that uses two methods and mixes the
 			results.  The first method is "fast", the other method
 			computes how much the suggestion sounds like the bad
 			word.  That only works when the language specifies
 			sound folding.  Can be slow and doesn't always give
 			better results.
 
 	fast		Internal method that only checks for simple changes:
 			character inserts/deletes/swaps.  Works well for
 			simple typing mistakes.
 
 	{number}	The maximum number of suggestions listed for |z=|.
 			Not used for |spellsuggest()|.  The number of
 			suggestions is never more than the value of `'lines'` 
 			minus two.
 
 	timeout:{millisec}   Limit the time searching for suggestions to
 			{millisec} milli seconds.  Applies to the following
 			methods.  When omitted the limit is 5000. When
 			negative there is no limit.
 
 	file:{filename} Read file {filename}, which must have two columns,
 			separated by a slash.  The first column contains the
 			bad word, the second column the suggested good word.
 			Example:
 				theribal/terrible ~
 			Use this for common mistakes that do not appear at the
 			top of the suggestion list with the internal methods.
 			Lines without a slash are ignored, use this for
 			comments.
 			The word in the second column must be correct,
 			otherwise it will not be used.  Add the word to an
 			".add" file if it is currently flagged as a spelling
 			mistake.
 			The file is used for all languages.
 
 	expr:{expr}	Evaluate expression {expr}.  Use a function to avoid
 			trouble with spaces.  |v:val| holds the badly spelled
 			word.  The expression must evaluate to a List of
 			Lists, each with a suggestion and a score.
 			Example:
 				[[`'the'` , 33], [`'that'` , 44]] ~
 			Set `'verbose'`  and use |z=| to see the scores that the
 			internal methods use.  A lower score is better.
 			This may invoke |spellsuggest()| if you temporarily
 			set `'spellsuggest'`  to exclude the "expr:" part.
 			Errors are silently ignored, unless you set the
 			`'verbose'`  option to a non-zero value.
 
 	Only one of "best", "double" or "fast" may be used.  The others may
 	appear several times in any order.  Example: >
 		:set sps=file:~/.config/nvim/sugg,best,expr:MySuggest()
 <
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## spk


```lua
string

## splitbelow


```lua
boolean
```

 `'splitbelow'`  `'sb'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, splitting a window will put the new window below the current
 	one. |:split|

## splitkeep


```lua
string
```

 `'splitkeep'`  `'spk'` 	string	(default "cursor")
 			global
 	The value of this option determines the scroll behavior when opening,
 	closing or resizing horizontal splits.
 
 	Possible values are:
 	  cursor	Keep the same relative cursor position.
 	  screen	Keep the text on the same screen line.
 	  topline	Keep the topline the same.
 
 	For the "screen" and "topline" values, the cursor position will be
 	changed when necessary. In this case, the jumplist will be populated
 	with the previous cursor position. For "screen", the text cannot always
 	be kept on the same screen line when `'wrap'`  is enabled.

## splitright


```lua
boolean
```

 `'splitright'`  `'spr'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, splitting a window will put the new window right of the

## startofline


```lua

```

 `'startofline'`  `'sol'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When "on" the commands listed below move the cursor to the first
 	non-blank of the line.  When off the cursor is kept in the same column
 	(if possible).  This applies to the commands: CTRL-D, CTRL-U, CTRL-B,
 	CTRL-F, "G", "H", "M", "L", gg, and to the commands "d", "<<" and ">>"
 	with a linewise operator, with "%" with a count and to buffer changing
 	commands (CTRL-^, :bnext, :bNext, etc.).  Also for an Ex command that
 	only has a line number, e.g., ":25" or ":+".
 	In case of buffer changing commands the cursor is placed at the column
 	where it was the last time the buffer was edited.

## stmp


```lua
boolean
```

## su


```lua
string
```

## suffixes


```lua
string
```

 `'suffixes'`  `'su'` 		string	(default ".bak,~,.o,.h,.info,.swp,.obj")
 			global
 	Files with these suffixes get a lower priority when multiple files
 	match a wildcard.  See |suffixes|.  Commas can be used to separate the
 	suffixes.  Spaces after the comma are ignored.  A dot is also seen as
 	the start of a suffix.  To avoid a dot or comma being recognized as a
 	separator, precede it with a backslash (see |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes).
 	See `'wildignore'`  for completely ignoring files.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	suffixes from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.

## swb


```lua
string
```

## switchbuf


```lua
string
```

 `'switchbuf'`  `'swb'` 	string	(default "uselast")
 			global
 	This option controls the behavior when switching between buffers.
 	Mostly for |quickfix| commands some values are also used for other
 	commands, as mentioned below.
 	Possible values (comma-separated list):
 	   useopen	If included, jump to the first open window that
 			contains the specified buffer (if there is one).
 			Otherwise: Do not examine other windows.
 			This setting is checked with |quickfix| commands, when
 			jumping to errors (":cc", ":cn", "cp", etc.).  It is
 			also used in all buffer related split commands, for
 			example ":sbuffer", ":sbnext", or ":sbrewind".
 	   usetab	Like "useopen", but also consider windows in other tab
 			pages.
 	   split	If included, split the current window before loading
 			a buffer for a |quickfix| command that display errors.
 			Otherwise: do not split, use current window (when used
 			in the quickfix window: the previously used window or
 			split if there is no other window).
 	   vsplit	Just like "split" but split vertically.
 	   newtab	Like "split", but open a new tab page.  Overrules
 			"split" when both are present.
 	   uselast	If included, jump to the previously used window when
 			jumping to errors with |quickfix| commands.

## sxe


```lua
string
```

## sxq


```lua
string
```

## tabline


```lua
string
```

 `'tabline'`  `'tal'` 		string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the tab pages
 	line at the top of the Vim window.  When empty Vim will use a default
 	tab pages line.  See |setting-tabline| for more info.
 
 	The tab pages line only appears as specified with the `'showtabline'` 
 	option and only when there is no GUI tab line.  When `'e'`  is in
 	`'guioptions'`  and the GUI supports a tab line `'guitablabel'`  is used
 	instead.  Note that the two tab pages lines are very different.
 
 	The value is evaluated like with `'statusline'` .  You can use
 	|tabpagenr()|, |tabpagewinnr()| and |tabpagebuflist()| to figure out
 	the text to be displayed.  Use "%1T" for the first label, "%2T" for
 	the second one, etc.  Use "%X" items for closing labels.
 
 	When changing something that is used in `'tabline'`  that does not
 	trigger it to be updated, use |:redrawtabline|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	Keep in mind that only one of the tab pages is the current one, others
 	are invisible and you can't jump to their windows.

## tabpagemax


```lua
integer
```

 `'tabpagemax'`  `'tpm'` 	number	(default 50)
 			global
 	Maximum number of tab pages to be opened by the |-p| command line
 	argument or the ":tab all" command. |tabpage|

## tagbsearch


```lua
boolean
```

 `'tagbsearch'`  `'tbs'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When searching for a tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command), Vim can either
 	use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
 	searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
 	will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
 	Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
 	they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
 	`'tagbsearch'`  option need to be switched off.
 
 	When `'tagbsearch'`  is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
 	files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
 	certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
 	`'tagbsearch'`  is off, only a linear search is done.
 
 	Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
 	at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted: >
    !_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/some comment/
 <	[The whitespace before and after the `'0'`  must be a single <Tab>]
 
 	When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
 	files listed in `'tags'` , and case is ignored or a pattern is used
 	instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
 	Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
 	be found in the retry.
 
 	If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
 	linear search can be avoided when case is ignored.  Use a value of `'2'` 
 	in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be case-fold
 	sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in the command:
 	"sort -f -o tags tags".  For Universal ctags and Exuberant ctags
 	version 5.x or higher (at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be
 	used for this as well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for
 	this to work.
 
 	By default, tag searches are case-sensitive.  Case is ignored when
 	`'ignorecase'`  is set and `'tagcase'`  is "followic", or when `'tagcase'`  is
 	"ignore".
 	Also when `'tagcase'`  is "followscs" and `'smartcase'`  is set, or
 	`'tagcase'`  is "smart", and the pattern contains only lowercase
 	characters.
 
 	When `'tagbsearch'`  is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
 	exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
 	files may only be found with `'tagbsearch'`  off.
 	When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
 	ASCII byte value), `'tagbsearch'`  should be off, or the line given above
 	must be included in the tags file.
 	This option doesn't affect commands that find all matching tags (e.g.,
 	command-line completion and ":help").

## taglength


```lua
integer
```

 `'taglength'`  `'tl'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 	If non-zero, tags are significant up to this number of characters.

## tagrelative


```lua
boolean
```

 `'tagrelative'`  `'tr'` 	boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	If on and using a tags file in another directory, file names in that
 	tags file are relative to the directory where the tags file is.

## tagstack


```lua
boolean
```

 `'tagstack'`  `'tgst'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, the |tagstack| is used normally.  When off, a ":tag" or
 	":tselect" command with an argument will not push the tag onto the
 	tagstack.  A following ":tag" without an argument, a ":pop" command or
 	any other command that uses the tagstack will use the unmodified
 	tagstack, but does change the pointer to the active entry.
 	Resetting this option is useful when using a ":tag" command in a
 	mapping which should not change the tagstack.

## tal

## termbidi


```lua
boolean
```

 `'termbidi'`  `'tbidi'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	The terminal is in charge of Bi-directionality of text (as specified
 	by Unicode).  The terminal is also expected to do the required shaping
 	that some languages (such as Arabic) require.
 	Setting this option implies that `'rightleft'`  will not be set when
 	`'arabic'`  is set and the value of `'arabicshape'`  will be ignored.
 	Note that setting `'termbidi'`  has the immediate effect that
 	`'arabicshape'`  is ignored, but `'rightleft'`  isn't changed automatically.
 	For further details see |arabic.txt|.

## termencoding


```lua
string
```

## termguicolors


```lua
boolean
```

 `'termguicolors'`  `'tgc'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	Enables 24-bit RGB color in the |TUI|.  Uses "gui" |:highlight|
 	attributes instead of "cterm" attributes. |guifg|
 	Requires an ISO-8613-3 compatible terminal.

## termpastefilter


```lua
string
```

 `'termpastefilter'`  `'tpf'` 	string	(default: "BS,HT,ESC,DEL")
 			global
 	A comma-separated list of options for specifying control characters
 	to be removed from the text pasted into the terminal window. The
 	supported values are:
 
 	   BS	    Backspace
 
 	   HT	    TAB
 
 	   FF	    Form feed
 
 	   ESC	    Escape
 
 	   DEL	    DEL
 
 	   C0	    Other control characters, excluding Line feed and
 		    Carriage return < ' '
 
 	   C1	    Control characters 0x80...0x9F

 `'tildeop'`  `'top'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on: The tilde command "~" behaves like an operator.

## timeout


```lua
boolean
```

 `'timeout'`  `'to'` 		boolean (default on)
 			global
 	This option and `'timeoutlen'`  determine the behavior when part of a
 	mapped key sequence has been received. For example, if <c-f> is
 	pressed and `'timeout'`  is set, Nvim will wait `'timeoutlen'`  milliseconds
 	for any key that can follow <c-f> in a mapping.

## timeoutlen


```lua
integer
```

 `'timeoutlen'`  `'tm'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global
 	Time in milliseconds to wait for a mapped sequence to complete.

## title


```lua
boolean
```

 `'title'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, the title of the window will be set to the value of
 	`'titlestring'`  (if it is not empty), or to:
 		filename [+=-] (path) - NVIM
 	Where:
 		filename	the name of the file being edited
 		-		indicates the file cannot be modified, `'ma'`  off
 		+		indicates the file was modified
 		=		indicates the file is read-only
 		=+		indicates the file is read-only and modified
 		(path)		is the path of the file being edited
 		- NVIM		the server name |v:servername| or "NVIM"

## titlelen


```lua
integer
```

 `'titlelen'` 		number	(default 85)
 			global
 	Gives the percentage of `'columns'`  to use for the length of the window
 	title.  When the title is longer, only the end of the path name is
 	shown.  A `'<'`  character before the path name is used to indicate this.
 	Using a percentage makes this adapt to the width of the window.  But
 	it won't work perfectly, because the actual number of characters
 	available also depends on the font used and other things in the title
 	bar.  When `'titlelen'`  is zero the full path is used.  Otherwise,
 	values from 1 to 30000 percent can be used.
 	`'titlelen'`  is also used for the `'titlestring'`  option.

## titleold


```lua
string
```

 `'titleold'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	If not empty, this option will be used to set the window title when
 	exiting.  Only if `'title'`  is enabled.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## titlestring


```lua
string
```

 `'titlestring'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the title of the
 	window.  This happens only when the `'title'`  option is on.
 
 	When this option contains printf-style `'%'`  items, they will be
 	expanded according to the rules used for `'statusline'` .
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	Example: >
 	    :auto BufEnter * let &titlestring = hostname() .. "/" .. expand("%:p")
 	    :set title titlestring=%<%F%=%l/%L-%P titlelen=70
 <	The value of `'titlelen'`  is used to align items in the middle or right
 	of the available space.
 	Some people prefer to have the file name first: >
 	    :set titlestring=%t%(\ %M%)%(\ (%{expand(\"%:~:.:h\")})%)%(\ %a%)
 <	Note the use of "%{ }" and an expression to get the path of the file,
 	without the file name.  The "%( %)" constructs are used to add a
 	separating space only when needed.
 	NOTE: Use of special characters in `'titlestring'`  may cause the display
 	to be garbled (e.g., when it contains a CR or NL character).

## ttimeout


```lua
boolean
```

 `'ttimeout'` 		boolean (default on)
 			global
 	This option and `'ttimeoutlen'`  determine the behavior when part of a
 	key code sequence has been received by the |TUI|.
 
 	For example if <Esc> (the \x1b byte) is received and `'ttimeout'`  is
 	set, Nvim waits `'ttimeoutlen'`  milliseconds for the terminal to
 	complete a key code sequence. If no input arrives before the timeout,
 	a single <Esc> is assumed. Many TUI cursor key codes start with <Esc>.
 
 	On very slow systems this may fail, causing cursor keys not to work
 	sometimes.  If you discover this problem you can ":set ttimeoutlen=9999".
 	Nvim will wait for the next character to arrive after an <Esc>.

## ttimeoutlen


```lua
integer
```

 `'ttimeoutlen'`  `'ttm'` 	number	(default 50)
 			global
 	Time in milliseconds to wait for a key code sequence to complete. Also
 	used for CTRL-\ CTRL-N and CTRL-\ CTRL-G when part of a command has
 	been typed.

## ttm

## undodir


```lua
string
```

 `'undodir'`  `'udir'` 	string	(default "$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/undo//")
 			global
 	List of directory names for undo files, separated with commas.
 	See `'backupdir'`  for details of the format.
 	"." means using the directory of the file.  The undo file name for
 	"file.txt" is ".file.txt.un~".
 	For other directories the file name is the full path of the edited
 	file, with path separators replaced with "%".
 	When writing: The first directory that exists is used.  "." always
 	works, no directories after "." will be used for writing.  If none of
 	the directories exist Nvim will attempt to create the last directory in
 	the list.
 	When reading all entries are tried to find an undo file.  The first
 	undo file that exists is used.  When it cannot be read an error is
 	given, no further entry is used.
 	See |undo-persistence|.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.
 
 	Note that unlike `'directory'`  and `'backupdir'` , `'undodir'`  always acts as
 	though the trailing slashes are present (see `'backupdir'`  for what this
 	means).

## undoreload


```lua
integer
```

 `'undoreload'`  `'ur'` 	number	(default 10000)
 			global
 	Save the whole buffer for undo when reloading it.  This applies to the
 	":e!" command and reloading for when the buffer changed outside of
 	Vim. |FileChangedShell|
 	The save only happens when this option is negative or when the number
 	of lines is smaller than the value of this option.
 	Set this option to zero to disable undo for a reload.
 
 	When saving undo for a reload, any undo file is not read.
 
 	Note that this causes the whole buffer to be stored in memory.  Set
 	this option to a lower value if you run out of memory.

## updatecount


```lua
integer
```

 `'updatecount'`  `'uc'` 	number	(default: 200)
 			global
 	After typing this many characters the swap file will be written to
 	disk.  When zero, no swap file will be created at all (see chapter on
 	recovery |crash-recovery|).  `'updatecount'`  is set to zero by starting
 	Vim with the "-n" option, see |startup|.  When editing in readonly
 	mode this option will be initialized to 10000.
 	The swapfile can be disabled per buffer with |`'swapfile'` |.
 	When `'updatecount'`  is set from zero to non-zero, swap files are
 	created for all buffers that have `'swapfile'`  set.  When `'updatecount'` 
 	is set to zero, existing swap files are not deleted.
 	This option has no meaning in buffers where |`'buftype'` | is "nofile"
 	or "nowrite".

## updatetime


```lua
integer
```

 `'updatetime'`  `'ut'` 	number	(default 4000)
 			global
 	If this many milliseconds nothing is typed the swap file will be

 `'verbose'`  `'vbs'` 		number	(default 0)
 			global
 	Sets the verbosity level.  Also set by |-V| and |:verbose|.
 
 	Tracing of options in Lua scripts is activated at level 1; Lua scripts
 	are not traced with verbose=0, for performance.
 
 	If greater than or equal to a given level, Nvim produces the following
 	messages:
 
 	Level   Messages ~
 	----------------------------------------------------------------------
 	1	Lua assignments to options, mappings, etc.
 	2	When a file is ":source"'ed, or |shada| file is read or written.
 	3	UI info, terminal capabilities.
 	4	Shell commands.
 	5	Every searched tags file and include file.
 	8	Files for which a group of autocommands is executed.
 	9	Executed autocommands.
 	11	Finding items in a path.
 	12	Vimscript function calls.
 	13	When an exception is thrown, caught, finished, or discarded.
 	14	Anything pending in a ":finally" clause.
 	15	Ex commands from a script (truncated at 200 characters).
 	16	Ex commands.
 
 	If `'verbosefile'`  is set then the verbose messages are not displayed.

## verbosefile


```lua
string
```

 `'verbosefile'`  `'vfile'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When not empty all messages are written in a file with this name.
 	When the file exists messages are appended.
 	Writing to the file ends when Vim exits or when `'verbosefile'`  is made
 	empty.  Writes are buffered, thus may not show up for some time.
 	Setting `'verbosefile'`  to a new value is like making it empty first.
 	The difference with |:redir| is that verbose messages are not
 	displayed when `'verbosefile'`  is set.

## vfile

 	Name of the directory where to store files for |:mkview|.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## viewoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'viewoptions'`  `'vop'` 	string	(default: "folds,cursor,curdir")
 			global
 	Changes the effect of the |:mkview| command.  It is a comma-separated
 	list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring something:

 `'whichwrap'`  `'ww'` 	string	(default: "b,s")
 			global
 	Allow specified keys that move the cursor left/right to move to the
 	previous/next line when the cursor is on the first/last character in
 	the line.  Concatenate characters to allow this for these keys:
 		char   key	  mode	~
 		 b    <BS>	 Normal and Visual
 		 s    <Space>	 Normal and Visual
 		 h    "h"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
 		 l    "l"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
 		 <    <Left>	 Normal and Visual
 		 >    <Right>	 Normal and Visual
 		 ~    "~"	 Normal
 		 [    <Left>	 Insert and Replace
 		 ]    <Right>	 Insert and Replace
 	For example: >
 		:set ww=<,>,[,]
 <	allows wrap only when cursor keys are used.
 	When the movement keys are used in combination with a delete or change
 	operator, the <EOL> also counts for a character.  This makes "3h"
 	different from "3dh" when the cursor crosses the end of a line.  This
 	is also true for "x" and "X", because they do the same as "dl" and
 	"dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
 	":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the
 	cursor.
 	When `'l'`  is included and it is used after an operator at the end of a
 	line (not an empty line) then it will not move to the next line.  This
 	makes "dl", "cl", "yl" etc. work normally.

## wi


```lua
integer
```

## wic


```lua
boolean
```

## wig


```lua
string
```

## wildchar


```lua
integer
```

 `'wildchar'`  `'wc'` 		number	(default: <Tab>)
 			global
 	Character you have to type to start wildcard expansion in the
 	command-line, as specified with `'wildmode'` .
 	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.
 	The character is not recognized when used inside a macro.  See
 	`'wildcharm'`  for that.
 	Some keys will not work, such as CTRL-C, <CR> and Enter.
 	Although `'wc'`  is a number option, you can set it to a special key: >
 		:set wc=<Tab>
 <

## wildcharm


```lua
integer
```

 `'wildcharm'`  `'wcm'` 	number	(default: none (0))
 			global
 	`'wildcharm'`  works exactly like `'wildchar'` , except that it is
 	recognized when used inside a macro.  You can find "spare" command-line
 	keys suitable for this option by looking at |ex-edit-index|.  Normally
 	you'll never actually type `'wildcharm'` , just use it in mappings that
 	automatically invoke completion mode, e.g.: >
 		:set wcm=<C-Z>
 		:cnoremap ss so $vim/sessions/*.vim<C-Z>
 <	Then after typing :ss you can use CTRL-P & CTRL-N.

## wildignore


```lua
string
```

 `'wildignore'`  `'wig'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	A list of file patterns.  A file that matches with one of these
 	patterns is ignored when expanding |wildcards|, completing file or
 	directory names, and influences the result of |expand()|, |glob()| and
 	|globpath()| unless a flag is passed to disable this.
 	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-pattern|.
 	Also see `'suffixes'` .
 	Example: >
 		:set wildignore=.obj
 <	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	a pattern from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.

## wildignorecase


```lua
boolean
```

 `'wildignorecase'`  `'wic'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When set case is ignored when completing file names and directories.
 	Has no effect when `'fileignorecase'`  is set.
 	Does not apply when the shell is used to expand wildcards, which
 	happens when there are special characters.

## wildmenu


```lua
boolean
```

 `'wildmenu'`  `'wmnu'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When `'wildmenu'`  is on, command-line completion operates in an enhanced
 	mode.  On pressing `'wildchar'`  (usually <Tab>) to invoke completion,
 	the possible matches are shown.
 	When `'wildoptions'`  contains "pum", then the completion matches are
 	shown in a popup menu.  Otherwise they are displayed just above the
 	command line, with the first match highlighted (overwriting the status
 	line, if there is one).
 	Keys that show the previous/next match, such as <Tab> or
 	CTRL-P/CTRL-N, cause the highlight to move to the appropriate match.
 	`'wildmode'`  must specify "full": "longest" and "list" do not start
 	`'wildmenu'`  mode. You can check the current mode with |wildmenumode()|.
 	The menu is cancelled when a key is hit that is not used for selecting
 	a completion.
 
 	While the menu is active these keys have special meanings:
 
 	CTRL-Y		- accept the currently selected match and stop
 			  completion.
 	CTRL-E		- end completion, go back to what was there before
 			  selecting a match.
 	<Left> <Right>	- select previous/next match (like CTRL-P/CTRL-N)
 	<Down>		- in filename/menu name completion: move into a
 			  subdirectory or submenu.
 	<CR>		- in menu completion, when the cursor is just after a
 			  dot: move into a submenu.
 	<Up>		- in filename/menu name completion: move up into
 			  parent directory or parent menu.
 
 	If you want <Left> and <Right> to move the cursor instead of selecting
 	a different match, use this: >
 		:cnoremap <Left> <Space><BS><Left>
 		:cnoremap <Right> <Space><BS><Right>
 <
 	|hl-WildMenu| highlights the current match.

## wildmode


```lua
string
```

 `'wildmode'`  `'wim'` 	string	(default: "full")
 			global
 	Completion mode that is used for the character specified with
 	`'wildchar'` .  It is a comma-separated list of up to four parts.  Each
 	part specifies what to do for each consecutive use of `'wildchar'` .  The
 	first part specifies the behavior for the first use of `'wildchar'` ,
 	The second part for the second use, etc.
 
 	Each part consists of a colon separated list consisting of the
 	following possible values:
 	""		Complete only the first match.
 	"full"		Complete the next full match.  After the last match,
 			the original string is used and then the first match
 			again.  Will also start `'wildmenu'`  if it is enabled.
 	"longest"	Complete till longest common string.  If this doesn't
 			result in a longer string, use the next part.
 	"list"		When more than one match, list all matches.
 	"lastused"	When completing buffer names and more than one buffer
 			matches, sort buffers by time last used (other than
 			the current buffer).
 	When there is only a single match, it is fully completed in all cases.
 
 	Examples of useful colon-separated values:
 	"longest:full"	Like "longest", but also start `'wildmenu'`  if it is
 			enabled.  Will not complete to the next full match.
 	"list:full"	When more than one match, list all matches and
 			complete first match.
 	"list:longest"	When more than one match, list all matches and
 			complete till longest common string.
 	"list:lastused" When more than one buffer matches, list all matches
 			and sort buffers by time last used (other than the
 			current buffer).
 
 	Examples: >
 		:set wildmode=full
 <	Complete first full match, next match, etc.  (the default) >
 		:set wildmode=longest,full
 <	Complete longest common string, then each full match >
 		:set wildmode=list:full
 <	List all matches and complete each full match >
 		:set wildmode=list,full
 <	List all matches without completing, then each full match >
 		:set wildmode=longest,list
 <	Complete longest common string, then list alternatives.
 	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.

## wildoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'wildoptions'`  `'wop'` 	string	(default "pum,tagfile")
 			global
 	A list of words that change how |cmdline-completion| is done.
 	The following values are supported:
 	  fuzzy		Use |fuzzy-matching| to find completion matches. When
 			this value is specified, wildcard expansion will not
 			be used for completion.  The matches will be sorted by
 			the "best match" rather than alphabetically sorted.
 			This will find more matches than the wildcard
 			expansion. Currently fuzzy matching based completion
 			is not supported for file and directory names and
 			instead wildcard expansion is used.
 	  pum		Display the completion matches using the popup menu
 			in the same style as the |ins-completion-menu|.
 	  tagfile	When using CTRL-D to list matching tags, the kind of
 			tag and the file of the tag is listed.	Only one match
 			is displayed per line.  Often used tag kinds are:
 				d	#define
 				f	function

## wim


```lua
string
```

## winaltkeys


```lua
string
```

 `'winaltkeys'`  `'wak'` 	string	(default "menu")
 			global
 			{only used in Win32}
 	Some GUI versions allow the access to menu entries by using the ALT
 	key in combination with a character that appears underlined in the
 	menu.  This conflicts with the use of the ALT key for mappings and
 	entering special characters.  This option tells what to do:
 	  no	Don't use ALT keys for menus.  ALT key combinations can be
 		mapped, but there is no automatic handling.
 	  yes	ALT key handling is done by the windowing system.  ALT key
 		combinations cannot be mapped.
 	  menu	Using ALT in combination with a character that is a menu
 		shortcut key, will be handled by the windowing system.  Other
 		keys can be mapped.
 	If the menu is disabled by excluding `'m'`  from `'guioptions'` , the ALT
 	key is never used for the menu.
 	This option is not used for <F10>; on Win32.

## window


```lua
integer
```

 `'window'`  `'wi'` 		number  (default screen height - 1)
 			global
 	Window height used for |CTRL-F| and |CTRL-B| when there is only one
 	window and the value is smaller than `'lines'`  minus one.  The screen
 	will scroll `'window'`  minus two lines, with a minimum of one.
 	When `'window'`  is equal to `'lines'`  minus one CTRL-F and CTRL-B scroll
 	in a much smarter way, taking care of wrapping lines.
 	When resizing the Vim window, the value is smaller than 1 or more than
 	or equal to `'lines'`  it will be set to `'lines'`  minus 1.
 	Note: Do not confuse this with the height of the Vim window, use
 	`'lines'`  for that.

## winheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'winheight'`  `'wh'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	Minimal number of lines for the current window.  This is not a hard
 	minimum, Vim will use fewer lines if there is not enough room.  If the
 	focus goes to a window that is smaller, its size is increased, at the
 	cost of the height of other windows.
 	Set `'winheight'`  to a small number for normal editing.
 	Set it to 999 to make the current window fill most of the screen.
 	Other windows will be only `'winminheight'`  high.  This has the drawback
 	that ":all" will create only two windows.  To avoid "vim -o 1 2 3 4"
 	to create only two windows, set the option after startup is done,
 	using the |VimEnter| event: >
 		au VimEnter * set winheight=999
 <	Minimum value is 1.
 	The height is not adjusted after one of the commands that change the
 	height of the current window.
 	`'winheight'`  applies to the current window.  Use `'winminheight'`  to set
 	the minimal height for other windows.

## winminheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'winminheight'`  `'wmh'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The minimal height of a window, when it's not the current window.
 	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
 	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero lines (i.e. just a
 	status bar) if necessary.  They will return to at least one line when
 	they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere to go.)
 	Use `'winheight'`  to set the minimal height of the current window.
 	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
 	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
 	windows.  A value of 0 to 3 is reasonable.

## winminwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'winminwidth'`  `'wmw'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The minimal width of a window, when it's not the current window.
 	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
 	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero columns (i.e. just
 	a vertical separator) if necessary.  They will return to at least one
 	line when they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere
 	to go.)
 	Use `'winwidth'`  to set the minimal width of the current window.
 	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
 	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
 	windows.  A value of 0 to 12 is reasonable.

## winwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'winwidth'`  `'wiw'` 	number	(default 20)
 			global
 	Minimal number of columns for the current window.  This is not a hard
 	minimum, Vim will use fewer columns if there is not enough room.  If
 	the current window is smaller, its size is increased, at the cost of
 	the width of other windows.  Set it to 999 to make the current window
 	always fill the screen.  Set it to a small number for normal editing.
 	The width is not adjusted after one of the commands to change the
 	width of the current window.
 	`'winwidth'`  applies to the current window.  Use `'winminwidth'`  to set
 	the minimal width for other windows.

## wrapscan


```lua
boolean
```

 `'wrapscan'`  `'ws'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Searches wrap around the end of the file.  Also applies to |]s| and
 	|[s|, searching for spelling mistakes.

## write


```lua
boolean
```

 `'write'` 			boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Allows writing files.  When not set, writing a file is not allowed.
 	Can be used for a view-only mode, where modifications to the text are
 	still allowed.  Can be reset with the |-m| or |-M| command line
 	argument.  Filtering text is still possible, even though this requires
 	writing a temporary file.

## writeany


```lua
boolean
```

 `'writeany'`  `'wa'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Allows writing to any file with no need for "!" override.

## writebackup


```lua
boolean
```

 `'writebackup'`  `'wb'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  The backup is removed after
 	the file was successfully written, unless the `'backup'`  option is
 	also on.
 	WARNING: Switching this option off means that when Vim fails to write
 	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
 	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only reset
 	this option if your file system is almost full and it makes the write
 	fail (and make sure not to exit Vim until the write was successful).
 	See |backup-table| for another explanation.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
 	Depending on `'backupcopy'`  the backup is a new file or the original
 	file renamed (and a new file is written).

# vim.opt

## acd


```lua
vim.opt.autochdir
```

 `'autochdir'`  `'acd'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When on, Vim will change the current working directory whenever you
 	open a file, switch buffers, delete a buffer or open/close a window.
 	It will change to the directory containing the file which was opened
 	or selected.  When a buffer has no name it also has no directory, thus
 	the current directory won't change when navigating to it.
 	Note: When this option is on some plugins may not work.

## ai


```lua
vim.opt.autoindent
```

 `'autoindent'`  `'ai'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	Copy indent from current line when starting a new line (typing <CR>
 	in Insert mode or when using the "o" or "O" command).  If you do not
 	type anything on the new line except <BS> or CTRL-D and then type
 	<Esc>, CTRL-O or <CR>, the indent is deleted again.  Moving the cursor
 	to another line has the same effect, unless the `'I'`  flag is included
 	in `'cpoptions'` .
 	When autoindent is on, formatting (with the "gq" command or when you
 	reach `'textwidth'`  in Insert mode) uses the indentation of the first
 	line.
 	When `'smartindent'`  or `'cindent'`  is on the indent is changed in
 	a different way.
 	{small difference from Vi: After the indent is deleted when typing
 	<Esc> or <CR>, the cursor position when moving up or down is after the
 	deleted indent; Vi puts the cursor somewhere in the deleted indent}.

## al


```lua
vim.opt.aleph
```

## aleph

## allowrevins


```lua
boolean
```

 `'allowrevins'`  `'ari'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Allow CTRL-_ in Insert and Command-line mode.  This is default off, to
 	avoid that users that accidentally type CTRL-_ instead of SHIFT-_ get
 	into reverse Insert mode, and don't know how to get out.  See
 	`'revins'` .

## ambiwidth


```lua
string
```

 `'ambiwidth'`  `'ambw'` 	string (default: "single")
 			global
 	Tells Vim what to do with characters with East Asian Width Class
 	Ambiguous (such as Euro, Registered Sign, Copyright Sign, Greek
 	letters, Cyrillic letters).
 
 	There are currently two possible values:
 	"single":	Use the same width as characters in US-ASCII.  This is
 			expected by most users.
 	"double":	Use twice the width of ASCII characters.
 
 	The value "double" cannot be used if `'listchars'`  or `'fillchars'` 
 	contains a character that would be double width.  These errors may
 	also be given when calling setcellwidths().
 
 	The values are overruled for characters specified with
 	|setcellwidths()|.
 
 	There are a number of CJK fonts for which the width of glyphs for
 	those characters are solely based on how many octets they take in
 	legacy/traditional CJK encodings.  In those encodings, Euro,
 	Registered sign, Greek/Cyrillic letters are represented by two octets,
 	therefore those fonts have "wide" glyphs for them.  This is also
 	true of some line drawing characters used to make tables in text
 	file.  Therefore, when a CJK font is used for GUI Vim or
 	Vim is running inside a terminal (emulators) that uses a CJK font
 	(or Vim is run inside an xterm invoked with "-cjkwidth" option.),
 	this option should be set to "double" to match the width perceived
 	by Vim with the width of glyphs in the font.  Perhaps it also has
 	to be set to "double" under CJK MS-Windows when the system locale is
 	set to one of CJK locales.  See Unicode Standard Annex #11
 	(https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11).

 `'autoread'`  `'ar'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	When a file has been detected to have been changed outside of Vim and

 	further details see |arabic.txt|.

## autochdir


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autochdir'`  `'acd'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When on, Vim will change the current working directory whenever you
 	open a file, switch buffers, delete a buffer or open/close a window.
 	It will change to the directory containing the file which was opened
 	or selected.  When a buffer has no name it also has no directory, thus
 	the current directory won't change when navigating to it.
 	Note: When this option is on some plugins may not work.

## autoindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autoindent'`  `'ai'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	Copy indent from current line when starting a new line (typing <CR>
 	in Insert mode or when using the "o" or "O" command).  If you do not
 	type anything on the new line except <BS> or CTRL-D and then type
 	<Esc>, CTRL-O or <CR>, the indent is deleted again.  Moving the cursor
 	to another line has the same effect, unless the `'I'`  flag is included
 	in `'cpoptions'` .
 	When autoindent is on, formatting (with the "gq" command or when you
 	reach `'textwidth'`  in Insert mode) uses the indentation of the first
 	line.
 	When `'smartindent'`  or `'cindent'`  is on the indent is changed in
 	a different way.
 	{small difference from Vi: After the indent is deleted when typing
 	<Esc> or <CR>, the cursor position when moving up or down is after the
 	deleted indent; Vi puts the cursor somewhere in the deleted indent}.

## autoread


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autoread'`  `'ar'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	When a file has been detected to have been changed outside of Vim and
 	it has not been changed inside of Vim, automatically read it again.
 	When the file has been deleted this is not done, so you have the text
 	from before it was deleted.  When it appears again then it is read.
 	|timestamp|
 	If this option has a local value, use this command to switch back to
 	using the global value: >
 		:set autoread<
 <

## autowrite


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autowrite'`  `'aw'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Write the contents of the file, if it has been modified, on each
 	`:next`, `:rewind`, `:last`, `:first`, `:previous`, `:stop`,
 	`:suspend`, `:tag`, `:!`, `:make`, CTRL-] and CTRL-^ command; and when
 	a `:buffer`, CTRL-O, CTRL-I, '{A-Z0-9}, or `{A-Z0-9} command takes one
 	to another file.
 	A buffer is not written if it becomes hidden, e.g. when `'bufhidden'`  is
 	set to "hide" and `:next` is used.
 	Note that for some commands the `'autowrite'`  option is not used, see
 	`'autowriteall'`  for that.
 	Some buffers will not be written, specifically when `'buftype'`  is
 	"nowrite", "nofile", "terminal" or "prompt".

## autowriteall


```lua
boolean
```

 `'autowriteall'`  `'awa'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Like `'autowrite'` , but also used for commands ":edit", ":enew", ":quit",
 	":qall", ":exit", ":xit", ":recover" and closing the Vim window.
 	Setting this option also implies that Vim behaves like `'autowrite'`  has
 	been set.

## aw


```lua
vim.opt.autowrite
```

 `'autowrite'`  `'aw'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Write the contents of the file, if it has been modified, on each
 	`:next`, `:rewind`, `:last`, `:first`, `:previous`, `:stop`,
 	`:suspend`, `:tag`, `:!`, `:make`, CTRL-] and CTRL-^ command; and when
 	a `:buffer`, CTRL-O, CTRL-I, '{A-Z0-9}, or `{A-Z0-9} command takes one
 	to another file.
 	A buffer is not written if it becomes hidden, e.g. when `'bufhidden'`  is
 	set to "hide" and `:next` is used.
 	Note that for some commands the `'autowrite'`  option is not used, see
 	`'autowriteall'`  for that.
 	Some buffers will not be written, specifically when `'buftype'`  is
 	"nowrite", "nofile", "terminal" or "prompt".

## awa


```lua
vim.opt.autowriteall
```

 `'autowriteall'`  `'awa'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Like `'autowrite'` , but also used for commands ":edit", ":enew", ":quit",
 	":qall", ":exit", ":xit", ":recover" and closing the Vim window.
 	Setting this option also implies that Vim behaves like `'autowrite'`  has
 	been set.

## background


```lua
string
```

 `'background'`  `'bg'` 	string	(default "dark")
 			global
 	When set to "dark" or "light", adjusts the default color groups for
 	that background type.  The |TUI| or other UI sets this on startup
 	(triggering |OptionSet|) if it can detect the background color.
 
 	This option does NOT change the background color, it tells Nvim what
 	the "inherited" (terminal/GUI) background looks like.
 	See |:hi-normal| if you want to set the background color explicitly.
 
 	When a color scheme is loaded (the "g:colors_name" variable is set)
 	setting `'background'`  will cause the color scheme to be reloaded.  If
 	the color scheme adjusts to the value of `'background'`  this will work.
 	However, if the color scheme sets `'background'`  itself the effect may
 	be undone.  First delete the "g:colors_name" variable when needed.
 
 	Normally this option would be set in the vimrc file.  Possibly
 	depending on the terminal name.  Example: >
 		:if $TERM ==# "xterm"
 		:  set background=dark
 		:endif
 <	When this option is set, the default settings for the highlight groups
 	will change.  To use other settings, place ":highlight" commands AFTER
 	the setting of the `'background'`  option.
 	This option is also used in the "$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim" file
 	to select the colors for syntax highlighting.  After changing this
 	option, you must load syntax.vim again to see the result.  This can be
 	done with ":syntax on".

## backspace


```lua
string
```

 `'backspace'`  `'bs'` 	string	(default "indent,eol,start")
 			global
 	Influences the working of <BS>, <Del>, CTRL-W and CTRL-U in Insert
 	mode.  This is a list of items, separated by commas.  Each item allows
 	a way to backspace over something:
 	value	effect	~
 	indent	allow backspacing over autoindent
 	eol	allow backspacing over line breaks (join lines)
 	start	allow backspacing over the start of insert; CTRL-W and CTRL-U
 		stop once at the start of insert.
 	nostop	like start, except CTRL-W and CTRL-U do not stop at the start of
 		insert.
 
 	When the value is empty, Vi compatible backspacing is used, none of
 	the ways mentioned for the items above are possible.
 
 	For backwards compatibility with version 5.4 and earlier:
 	value	effect	~
 	  0	same as ":set backspace=" (Vi compatible)
 	  1	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol"
 	  2	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol,start"
 	  3	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol,nostop"

## backup


```lua
boolean
```

 `'backup'`  `'bk'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  Leave it around after the
 	file has been successfully written.  If you do not want to keep the
 	backup file, but you do want a backup while the file is being
 	written, reset this option and set the `'writebackup'`  option (this is
 	the default).  If you do not want a backup file at all reset both
 	options (use this if your file system is almost full).  See the
 	|backup-table| for more explanations.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
 	When `'patchmode'`  is set, the backup may be renamed to become the
 	oldest version of a file.

## backupcopy


```lua
string
```

 `'backupcopy'`  `'bkc'` 	string	(default: "auto")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
 	done.  This is a comma-separated list of words.
 
 	The main values are:
 	"yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
 	"no"	rename the file and write a new one
 	"auto"	one of the previous, what works best
 
 	Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
 	"breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
 	"breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing
 
 	Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
 	- Takes extra time to copy the file.
 	+ When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
 	  has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
 	- When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
 	  not of the real file.
 
 	Renaming the file and writing a new one:
 	+ It's fast.
 	- Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
 	  file.
 	- When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.
 
 	The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming the
 	file is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on
 	and the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected,
 	a copy will be made.
 
 	The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
 	combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
 	force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
 	exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
 	become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
 	useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
 	hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
 	be propagated back to the original source.
 
 	One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
 	that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
 	the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
 	backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
 	example.
 
 	When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
 	with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
 	symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file,
 	however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
 	group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
 	fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
 	others.
 
 	When the file is renamed, this is the other way around: The backup has
 	the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
 	is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
 	link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
 	rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
 	written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
 	the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
 	again not rename the file.

## backupdir


```lua
string
```

 `'backupdir'`  `'bdir'` 	string	(default ".,$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/backup//")
 			global
 	List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
 	- The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
 	  where this is possible.  If none of the directories exist Nvim will
 	  attempt to create the last directory in the list.
 	- Empty means that no backup file will be created (`'patchmode'`  is
 	  impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
 	- A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
 	  as the edited file.
 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
 	  the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
 	  ("." inside a directory name has no special meaning).
 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
 	- A directory name may end in an `'/'` .
 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
 	  with all path separators changed to percent `'%'`  signs. This will
 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the backup directory.
 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
 	  use `'//'` , instead of `'\\'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type one before a space, type two to
 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
 	    :set bdir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
 <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a `'>'`  at the start
 	  of the option is removed.
 	See also `'backup'`  and `'writebackup'`  options.
 	If you want to hide your backup files on Unix, consider this value: >
 		:set backupdir=./.backup,~/.backup,.,/tmp
 <	You must create a ".backup" directory in each directory and in your
 	home directory for this to work properly.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## backupext


```lua
string
```

 `'backupext'`  `'bex'` 	string	(default "~")
 			global
 	String which is appended to a file name to make the name of the
 	backup file.  The default is quite unusual, because this avoids
 	accidentally overwriting existing files with a backup file.  You might
 	prefer using ".bak", but make sure that you don't have files with
 	".bak" that you want to keep.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used; "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
 
 	If you like to keep a lot of backups, you could use a BufWritePre
 	autocommand to change `'backupext'`  just before writing the file to
 	include a timestamp. >
 		:au BufWritePre * let &bex = `'-'`  .. strftime("%Y%b%d%X") .. `'~'` 
 <	Use `'backupdir'`  to put the backup in a different directory.

## backupskip


```lua
string
```

 `'backupskip'`  `'bsk'` 	string	(default: "$TMPDIR/,$TEMP/*"
 				 Unix: "/tmp/,$TMP/"
 				 Mac: "/private/tmp/,$TMP/")
 			global
 	A list of file patterns.  When one of the patterns matches with the
 	name of the file which is written, no backup file is created.  Both
 	the specified file name and the full path name of the file are used.
 	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-pattern|.
 	Watch out for special characters, see |option-backslash|.
 	When $TMPDIR, $TMP or $TEMP is not defined, it is not used for the
 	default value.  "/tmp/*" is only used for Unix.
 
 	WARNING: Not having a backup file means that when Vim fails to write
 	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
 	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only disable
 	backups if you don't care about losing the file.
 
 	Note that environment variables are not expanded.  If you want to use
 	$HOME you must expand it explicitly, e.g.: >
 		:let &backupskip = escape(expand(`'$HOME'` ), `'\'` ) .. `'/tmp/*'` 
 
 <	Note that the default also makes sure that "crontab -e" works (when a
 	backup would be made by renaming the original file crontab won't see
 	the newly created file).  Also see `'backupcopy'`  and |crontab|.

## bdir


```lua
vim.opt.backupdir
```

 `'backupdir'`  `'bdir'` 	string	(default ".,$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/backup//")
 			global
 	List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
 	- The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
 	  where this is possible.  If none of the directories exist Nvim will
 	  attempt to create the last directory in the list.
 	- Empty means that no backup file will be created (`'patchmode'`  is
 	  impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
 	- A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
 	  as the edited file.
 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
 	  the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
 	  ("." inside a directory name has no special meaning).
 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
 	  name, precede it with a backslash.

 	security reasons.

## belloff


```lua
string
```

 `'belloff'`  `'bo'` 		string	(default "all")
 			global
 	Specifies for which events the bell will not be rung. It is a comma-
 	separated list of items. For each item that is present, the bell
 	will be silenced. This is most useful to specify specific events in
 	insert mode to be silenced.
 
 	item	    meaning when present	~
 	all	    All events.
 	backspace   When hitting <BS> or <Del> and deleting results in an
 		    error.
 	cursor	    Fail to move around using the cursor keys or
 		    <PageUp>/<PageDown> in |Insert-mode|.
 	complete    Error occurred when using |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K| or
 		    |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.
 	copy	    Cannot copy char from insert mode using |i_CTRL-Y| or
 		    |i_CTRL-E|.
 	ctrlg	    Unknown Char after <C-G> in Insert mode.
 	error	    Other Error occurred (e.g. try to join last line)
 		    (mostly used in |Normal-mode| or |Cmdline-mode|).
 	esc	    hitting <Esc> in |Normal-mode|.
 	hangul	    Ignored.
 	lang	    Calling the beep module for Lua/Mzscheme/TCL.
 	mess	    No output available for |g<|.
 	showmatch   Error occurred for `'showmatch'`  function.
 	operator    Empty region error |cpo-E|.
 	register    Unknown register after <C-R> in |Insert-mode|.
 	shell	    Bell from shell output |:!|.
 	spell	    Error happened on spell suggest.
 	wildmode    More matches in |cmdline-completion| available
 		    (depends on the `'wildmode'`  setting).
 
 	This is most useful to fine tune when in Insert mode the bell should
 	be rung. For Normal mode and Ex commands, the bell is often rung to
 	indicate that an error occurred. It can be silenced by adding the
 	"error" keyword.

## bex


```lua
vim.opt.backupext
```

 `'backupext'`  `'bex'` 	string	(default "~")
 			global
 	String which is appended to a file name to make the name of the
 	backup file.  The default is quite unusual, because this avoids
 	accidentally overwriting existing files with a backup file.  You might
 	prefer using ".bak", but make sure that you don't have files with
 	".bak" that you want to keep.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used; "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
 
 	If you like to keep a lot of backups, you could use a BufWritePre
 	autocommand to change `'backupext'`  just before writing the file to
 	include a timestamp. >
 		:au BufWritePre * let &bex = `'-'`  .. strftime("%Y%b%d%X") .. `'~'` 
 <	Use `'backupdir'`  to put the backup in a different directory.

## bg


```lua
vim.opt.background
```

 `'background'`  `'bg'` 	string	(default "dark")
 			global
 	When set to "dark" or "light", adjusts the default color groups for
 	that background type.  The |TUI| or other UI sets this on startup
 	(triggering |OptionSet|) if it can detect the background color.
 
 	This option does NOT change the background color, it tells Nvim what
 	the "inherited" (terminal/GUI) background looks like.
 	See |:hi-normal| if you want to set the background color explicitly.
 
 	When a color scheme is loaded (the "g:colors_name" variable is set)
 	setting `'background'`  will cause the color scheme to be reloaded.  If
 	the color scheme adjusts to the value of `'background'`  this will work.
 	However, if the color scheme sets `'background'`  itself the effect may
 	be undone.  First delete the "g:colors_name" variable when needed.
 
 	Normally this option would be set in the vimrc file.  Possibly
 	depending on the terminal name.  Example: >
 		:if $TERM ==# "xterm"
 		:  set background=dark
 		:endif
 <	When this option is set, the default settings for the highlight groups
 	will change.  To use other settings, place ":highlight" commands AFTER
 	the setting of the `'background'`  option.
 	This option is also used in the "$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim" file
 	to select the colors for syntax highlighting.  After changing this
 	option, you must load syntax.vim again to see the result.  This can be
 	done with ":syntax on".

## bh


```lua
vim.opt.bufhidden
```

 `'bufhidden'`  `'bh'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies what happens when a buffer is no longer
 	displayed in a window:
 	  <empty>	follow the global `'hidden'`  option
 	  hide		hide the buffer (don't unload it), even if `'hidden'`  is
 			not set
 	  unload	unload the buffer, even if `'hidden'`  is set; the
 			|:hide| command will also unload the buffer
 	  delete	delete the buffer from the buffer list, even if
 			`'hidden'`  is set; the |:hide| command will also delete
 			the buffer, making it behave like |:bdelete|
 	  wipe		wipe the buffer from the buffer list, even if
 			`'hidden'`  is set; the |:hide| command will also wipe
 			out the buffer, making it behave like |:bwipeout|
 
 	CAREFUL: when "unload", "delete" or "wipe" is used changes in a buffer
 	are lost without a warning.  Also, these values may break autocommands
 	that switch between buffers temporarily.
 	This option is used together with `'buftype'`  and `'swapfile'`  to specify
 	special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

## bin


```lua
vim.opt.binary
```

 `'binary'`  `'bin'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	This option should be set before editing a binary file.  You can also
 	use the |-b| Vim argument.  When this option is switched on a few
 	options will be changed (also when it already was on):
 		`'textwidth'`   will be set to 0
 		`'wrapmargin'`  will be set to 0
 		`'modeline'`    will be off
 		`'expandtab'`   will be off
 	Also, `'fileformat'`  and `'fileformats'`  options will not be used, the
 	file is read and written like `'fileformat'`  was "unix" (a single <NL>
 	separates lines).
 	The `'fileencoding'`  and `'fileencodings'`  options will not be used, the
 	file is read without conversion.
 	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the `'bin'`  option is
 	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
 	`'textwidth'` ), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
 	`'bin'`  again when the file has been loaded.
 	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when
 	`'bin'`  is switched from on to off.  Each buffer has its own set of
 	saved option values.
 	To edit a file with `'binary'`  set you can use the |++bin| argument.
 	This avoids you have to do ":set bin", which would have effect for all
 	files you edit.
 	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
 	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
 	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See
 	the `'endofline'`  option.

## binary


```lua
boolean
```

 `'binary'`  `'bin'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	This option should be set before editing a binary file.  You can also
 	use the |-b| Vim argument.  When this option is switched on a few
 	options will be changed (also when it already was on):
 		`'textwidth'`   will be set to 0
 		`'wrapmargin'`  will be set to 0
 		`'modeline'`    will be off
 		`'expandtab'`   will be off
 	Also, `'fileformat'`  and `'fileformats'`  options will not be used, the
 	file is read and written like `'fileformat'`  was "unix" (a single <NL>
 	separates lines).
 	The `'fileencoding'`  and `'fileencodings'`  options will not be used, the
 	file is read without conversion.
 	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the `'bin'`  option is
 	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
 	`'textwidth'` ), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
 	`'bin'`  again when the file has been loaded.
 	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when
 	`'bin'`  is switched from on to off.  Each buffer has its own set of
 	saved option values.
 	To edit a file with `'binary'`  set you can use the |++bin| argument.
 	This avoids you have to do ":set bin", which would have effect for all
 	files you edit.
 	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
 	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
 	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See
 	the `'endofline'`  option.

## bk


```lua
vim.opt.backup
```

 `'backup'`  `'bk'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  Leave it around after the
 	file has been successfully written.  If you do not want to keep the
 	backup file, but you do want a backup while the file is being
 	written, reset this option and set the `'writebackup'`  option (this is
 	the default).  If you do not want a backup file at all reset both
 	options (use this if your file system is almost full).  See the
 	|backup-table| for more explanations.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
 	When `'patchmode'`  is set, the backup may be renamed to become the
 	oldest version of a file.

## bkc


```lua
vim.opt.backupcopy
```

 `'backupcopy'`  `'bkc'` 	string	(default: "auto")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
 	done.  This is a comma-separated list of words.
 
 	The main values are:
 	"yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
 	"no"	rename the file and write a new one
 	"auto"	one of the previous, what works best
 
 	Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
 	"breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
 	"breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing
 
 	Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
 	- Takes extra time to copy the file.
 	+ When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
 	  has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
 	- When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
 	  not of the real file.
 
 	Renaming the file and writing a new one:
 	+ It's fast.
 	- Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
 	  file.
 	- When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.
 
 	The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming the
 	file is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on
 	and the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected,
 	a copy will be made.
 
 	The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
 	combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
 	force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
 	exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
 	become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
 	useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
 	hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
 	be propagated back to the original source.
 
 	One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
 	that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
 	the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
 	backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
 	example.
 
 	When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
 	with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
 	symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file,
 	however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
 	group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
 	fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
 	others.
 
 	When the file is renamed, this is the other way around: The backup has
 	the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
 	is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
 	link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
 	rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
 	written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
 	the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
 	again not rename the file.

## bl


```lua
vim.opt.buflisted
```

 `'buflisted'`  `'bl'` 	boolean (default: on)
 			local to buffer
 	When this option is set, the buffer shows up in the buffer list.  If
 	it is reset it is not used for ":bnext", "ls", the Buffers menu, etc.
 	This option is reset by Vim for buffers that are only used to remember
 	a file name or marks.  Vim sets it when starting to edit a buffer.
 	But not when moving to a buffer with ":buffer".

## bo


```lua
vim.opt.belloff
```

 `'belloff'`  `'bo'` 		string	(default "all")
 			global
 	Specifies for which events the bell will not be rung. It is a comma-
 	separated list of items. For each item that is present, the bell
 	will be silenced. This is most useful to specify specific events in
 	insert mode to be silenced.
 
 	item	    meaning when present	~
 	all	    All events.
 	backspace   When hitting <BS> or <Del> and deleting results in an
 		    error.
 	cursor	    Fail to move around using the cursor keys or
 		    <PageUp>/<PageDown> in |Insert-mode|.
 	complete    Error occurred when using |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K| or
 		    |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.
 	copy	    Cannot copy char from insert mode using |i_CTRL-Y| or
 		    |i_CTRL-E|.
 	ctrlg	    Unknown Char after <C-G> in Insert mode.
 	error	    Other Error occurred (e.g. try to join last line)
 		    (mostly used in |Normal-mode| or |Cmdline-mode|).
 	esc	    hitting <Esc> in |Normal-mode|.
 	hangul	    Ignored.
 	lang	    Calling the beep module for Lua/Mzscheme/TCL.
 	mess	    No output available for |g<|.
 	showmatch   Error occurred for `'showmatch'`  function.
 	operator    Empty region error |cpo-E|.
 	register    Unknown register after <C-R> in |Insert-mode|.
 	shell	    Bell from shell output |:!|.
 	spell	    Error happened on spell suggest.
 	wildmode    More matches in |cmdline-completion| available
 		    (depends on the `'wildmode'`  setting).
 
 	This is most useful to fine tune when in Insert mode the bell should
 	be rung. For Normal mode and Ex commands, the bell is often rung to
 	indicate that an error occurred. It can be silenced by adding the
 	"error" keyword.

## bomb


```lua
boolean
```

 `'bomb'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When writing a file and the following conditions are met, a BOM (Byte
 	Order Mark) is prepended to the file:
 	- this option is on
 	- the `'binary'`  option is off
 	- `'fileencoding'`  is "utf-8", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" or one of the little/big
 	  endian variants.
 	Some applications use the BOM to recognize the encoding of the file.
 	Often used for UCS-2 files on MS-Windows.  For other applications it
 	causes trouble, for example: "cat file1 file2" makes the BOM of file2
 	appear halfway through the resulting file.  Gcc doesn't accept a BOM.
 	When Vim reads a file and `'fileencodings'`  starts with "ucs-bom", a
 	check for the presence of the BOM is done and `'bomb'`  set accordingly.
 	Unless `'binary'`  is set, it is removed from the first line, so that you
 	don't see it when editing.  When you don't change the options, the BOM
 	will be restored when writing the file.

## breakat


```lua
string
```

 `'breakat'`  `'brk'` 		string	(default " ^I!@*-+;:,./?")
 			global
 	This option lets you choose which characters might cause a line
 	break if `'linebreak'`  is on.  Only works for ASCII characters.

## breakindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'breakindent'`  `'bri'` 	boolean (default off)
 			local to window
 	Every wrapped line will continue visually indented (same amount of
 	space as the beginning of that line), thus preserving horizontal blocks
 	of text.

## breakindentopt


```lua
string
```

 `'breakindentopt'`  `'briopt'`  string (default empty)
 			local to window
 	Settings for `'breakindent'` . It can consist of the following optional
 	items and must be separated by a comma:
 		min:{n}	    Minimum text width that will be kept after
 			    applying `'breakindent'` , even if the resulting
 			    text should normally be narrower. This prevents
 			    text indented almost to the right window border
 			    occupying lot of vertical space when broken.
 			    (default: 20)
 		shift:{n}   After applying `'breakindent'` , the wrapped line's
 			    beginning will be shifted by the given number of
 			    characters.  It permits dynamic French paragraph
 			    indentation (negative) or emphasizing the line
 			    continuation (positive).
 			    (default: 0)
 		sbr	    Display the `'showbreak'`  value before applying the
 			    additional indent.
 			    (default: off)
 		list:{n}    Adds an additional indent for lines that match a
 			    numbered or bulleted list (using the
 			    `'formatlistpat'`  setting).
 		list:-1	    Uses the length of a match with `'formatlistpat'` 
 			    for indentation.
 			    (default: 0)
 		column:{n}  Indent at column {n}. Will overrule the other
 			    sub-options. Note: an additional indent may be
 			    added for the `'showbreak'`  setting.
 			    (default: off)

## bri


```lua
vim.opt.breakindent
```

 `'breakindent'`  `'bri'` 	boolean (default off)
 			local to window
 	Every wrapped line will continue visually indented (same amount of
 	space as the beginning of that line), thus preserving horizontal blocks
 	of text.

## briopt


```lua
vim.opt.breakindentopt
```

 `'breakindentopt'`  `'briopt'`  string (default empty)
 			local to window
 	Settings for `'breakindent'` . It can consist of the following optional
 	items and must be separated by a comma:

 			    (default: off)
 		list:{n}    Adds an additional indent for lines that match a
 			    numbered or bulleted list (using the
 			    `'formatlistpat'`  setting).
 		list:-1	    Uses the length of a match with `'formatlistpat'` 
 			    for indentation.
 			    (default: 0)
 		column:{n}  Indent at column {n}. Will overrule the other
 			    sub-options. Note: an additional indent may be
 			    added for the `'showbreak'`  setting.
 			    (default: off)

## brk


```lua
vim.opt.breakat
```

 `'breakat'`  `'brk'` 		string	(default " ^I!@*-+;:,./?")
 			global
 	This option lets you choose which characters might cause a line
 	break if `'linebreak'`  is on.  Only works for ASCII characters.

## browsedir


```lua
string
```

 `'browsedir'`  `'bsdir'` 	string	(default: "last")
 			global
 	Which directory to use for the file browser:
 	   last		Use same directory as with last file browser, where a
 			file was opened or saved.
 	   buffer	Use the directory of the related buffer.
 	   current	Use the current directory.
 	   {path}	Use the specified directory

## bs


```lua
vim.opt.backspace
```

 `'backspace'`  `'bs'` 	string	(default "indent,eol,start")
 			global
 	Influences the working of <BS>, <Del>, CTRL-W and CTRL-U in Insert
 	mode.  This is a list of items, separated by commas.  Each item allows
 	a way to backspace over something:
 	value	effect	~
 	indent	allow backspacing over autoindent
 	eol	allow backspacing over line breaks (join lines)
 	start	allow backspacing over the start of insert; CTRL-W and CTRL-U
 		stop once at the start of insert.
 	nostop	like start, except CTRL-W and CTRL-U do not stop at the start of
 		insert.
 
 	When the value is empty, Vi compatible backspacing is used, none of
 	the ways mentioned for the items above are possible.
 
 	For backwards compatibility with version 5.4 and earlier:
 	value	effect	~
 	  0	same as ":set backspace=" (Vi compatible)
 	  1	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol"
 	  2	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol,start"
 	  3	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol,nostop"

## bsdir


```lua
vim.opt.browsedir
```

 `'browsedir'`  `'bsdir'` 	string	(default: "last")
 			global
 	Which directory to use for the file browser:
 	   last		Use same directory as with last file browser, where a
 			file was opened or saved.
 	   buffer	Use the directory of the related buffer.
 	   current	Use the current directory.
 	   {path}	Use the specified directory

## bsk


```lua
vim.opt.backupskip
```

 `'backupskip'`  `'bsk'` 	string	(default: "$TMPDIR/,$TEMP/*"
 				 Unix: "/tmp/,$TMP/"
 				 Mac: "/private/tmp/,$TMP/")
 			global
 	A list of file patterns.  When one of the patterns matches with the
 	name of the file which is written, no backup file is created.  Both
 	the specified file name and the full path name of the file are used.
 	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-pattern|.
 	Watch out for special characters, see |option-backslash|.
 	When $TMPDIR, $TMP or $TEMP is not defined, it is not used for the
 	default value.  "/tmp/*" is only used for Unix.
 
 	WARNING: Not having a backup file means that when Vim fails to write
 	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
 	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only disable
 	backups if you don't care about losing the file.
 
 	Note that environment variables are not expanded.  If you want to use
 	$HOME you must expand it explicitly, e.g.: >
 		:let &backupskip = escape(expand(`'$HOME'` ), `'\'` ) .. `'/tmp/*'` 
 
 <	Note that the default also makes sure that "crontab -e" works (when a
 	backup would be made by renaming the original file crontab won't see
 	the newly created file).  Also see `'backupcopy'`  and |crontab|.

## bt


```lua
vim.opt.buftype
```

 `'buftype'`  `'bt'` 		string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	The value of this option specifies the type of a buffer:
 	  <empty>	normal buffer
 	  acwrite	buffer will always be written with |BufWriteCmd|s
 	  help		help buffer (do not set this manually)
 	  nofile	buffer is not related to a file, will not be written
 	  nowrite	buffer will not be written
 	  quickfix	list of errors |:cwindow| or locations |:lwindow|
 	  terminal	|terminal-emulator| buffer
 	  prompt	buffer where only the last line can be edited, meant
 			to be used by a plugin, see |prompt-buffer|
 
 	This option is used together with `'bufhidden'`  and `'swapfile'`  to
 	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.
 	Also see |win_gettype()|, which returns the type of the window.
 
 	Be careful with changing this option, it can have many side effects!
 	One such effect is that Vim will not check the timestamp of the file,
 	if the file is changed by another program this will not be noticed.
 
 	A "quickfix" buffer is only used for the error list and the location
 	list.  This value is set by the |:cwindow| and |:lwindow| commands and
 	you are not supposed to change it.
 
 	"nofile" and "nowrite" buffers are similar:
 	both:		The buffer is not to be written to disk, ":w" doesn't
 			work (":w filename" does work though).
 	both:		The buffer is never considered to be |`'modified'` |.
 			There is no warning when the changes will be lost, for
 			example when you quit Vim.
 	both:		A swap file is only created when using too much memory
 			(when `'swapfile'`  has been reset there is never a swap
 			file).
 	nofile only:	The buffer name is fixed, it is not handled like a
 			file name.  It is not modified in response to a |:cd|
 			command.
 	both:		When using ":e bufname" and already editing "bufname"
 			the buffer is made empty and autocommands are
 			triggered as usual for |:edit|.
 
 	"acwrite" implies that the buffer name is not related to a file, like
 	"nofile", but it will be written.  Thus, in contrast to "nofile" and
 	"nowrite", ":w" does work and a modified buffer can't be abandoned
 	without saving.  For writing there must be matching |BufWriteCmd|,
 	|FileWriteCmd| or |FileAppendCmd| autocommands.

## bufhidden


```lua
string
```

 `'bufhidden'`  `'bh'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies what happens when a buffer is no longer
 	displayed in a window:
 	  <empty>	follow the global `'hidden'`  option
 	  hide		hide the buffer (don't unload it), even if `'hidden'`  is
 			not set
 	  unload	unload the buffer, even if `'hidden'`  is set; the
 			|:hide| command will also unload the buffer
 	  delete	delete the buffer from the buffer list, even if
 			`'hidden'`  is set; the |:hide| command will also delete
 			the buffer, making it behave like |:bdelete|
 	  wipe		wipe the buffer from the buffer list, even if
 			`'hidden'`  is set; the |:hide| command will also wipe
 			out the buffer, making it behave like |:bwipeout|
 
 	CAREFUL: when "unload", "delete" or "wipe" is used changes in a buffer
 	are lost without a warning.  Also, these values may break autocommands
 	that switch between buffers temporarily.
 	This option is used together with `'buftype'`  and `'swapfile'`  to specify
 	special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

## buflisted


```lua
boolean
```

 `'buflisted'`  `'bl'` 	boolean (default: on)
 			local to buffer
 	When this option is set, the buffer shows up in the buffer list.  If
 	it is reset it is not used for ":bnext", "ls", the Buffers menu, etc.
 	This option is reset by Vim for buffers that are only used to remember
 	a file name or marks.  Vim sets it when starting to edit a buffer.
 	But not when moving to a buffer with ":buffer".

## buftype


```lua
string
```

 `'buftype'`  `'bt'` 		string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	The value of this option specifies the type of a buffer:
 	  <empty>	normal buffer

## casemap


```lua
string
```

 `'casemap'`  `'cmp'` 		string	(default: "internal,keepascii")
 			global
 	Specifies details about changing the case of letters.  It may contain
 	these words, separated by a comma:
 	internal	Use internal case mapping functions, the current
 			locale does not change the case mapping. When
 			"internal" is omitted, the towupper() and towlower()
 			system library functions are used when available.
 	keepascii	For the ASCII characters (0x00 to 0x7f) use the US
 			case mapping, the current locale is not effective.
 			This probably only matters for Turkish.

## cb


```lua
vim.opt.clipboard
```

 `'clipboard'`  `'cb'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This option is a list of comma-separated names.
 	These names are recognized:
 
 
 	unnamed		When included, Vim will use the clipboard register "*"
 			for all yank, delete, change and put operations which
 			would normally go to the unnamed register.  When a
 			register is explicitly specified, it will always be
 			used regardless of whether "unnamed" is in `'clipboard'` 
 			or not.  The clipboard register can always be
 			explicitly accessed using the "* notation.  Also see
 			|clipboard|.
 
 
 	unnamedplus	A variant of the "unnamed" flag which uses the
 			clipboard register "+" (|quoteplus|) instead of
 			register "*" for all yank, delete, change and put
 			operations which would normally go to the unnamed
 			register.  When "unnamed" is also included to the
 			option, yank and delete operations (but not put)
 			will additionally copy the text into register
 			`'*'` . See |clipboard|.

## cc


```lua
vim.opt.colorcolumn
```

 `'colorcolumn'`  `'cc'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to window
 	`'colorcolumn'`  is a comma-separated list of screen columns that are
 	highlighted with ColorColumn |hl-ColorColumn|.  Useful to align
 	text.  Will make screen redrawing slower.
 	The screen column can be an absolute number, or a number preceded with
 	`'+'`  or `'-'` , which is added to or subtracted from `'textwidth'` . >
 
 		:set cc=+1  " highlight column after `'textwidth'` 
 		:set cc=+1,+2,+3  " highlight three columns after `'textwidth'` 
 		:hi ColorColumn ctermbg=lightgrey guibg=lightgrey
 <
 	When `'textwidth'`  is zero then the items with `'-'`  and `'+'`  are not used.
 	A maximum of 256 columns are highlighted.

## ccv


```lua
vim.opt.charconvert
```

 `'charconvert'`  `'ccv'` 	string (default "")
 			global
 	An expression that is used for character encoding conversion.  It is
 	evaluated when a file that is to be read or has been written has a
 	different encoding from what is desired.
 	`'charconvert'`  is not used when the internal iconv() function is
 	supported and is able to do the conversion.  Using iconv() is
 	preferred, because it is much faster.
 	`'charconvert'`  is not used when reading stdin |--|, because there is no
 	file to convert from.  You will have to save the text in a file first.
 	The expression must return zero, false or an empty string for success,
 	non-zero or true for failure.
 	See |encoding-names| for possible encoding names.
 	Additionally, names given in `'fileencodings'`  and `'fileencoding'`  are
 	used.
 	Conversion between "latin1", "unicode", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" and "utf-8"
 	is done internally by Vim, `'charconvert'`  is not used for this.
 	Also used for Unicode conversion.
 	Example: >
 		set charconvert=CharConvert()
 		fun CharConvert()
 		  system("recode "
 			\ .. v:charconvert_from .. ".." .. v:charconvert_to
 			\ .. " <" .. v:fname_in .. " >" .. v:fname_out)
 		  return v:shell_error
 		endfun
 <	The related Vim variables are:
 		v:charconvert_from	name of the current encoding
 		v:charconvert_to	name of the desired encoding
 		v:fname_in		name of the input file
 		v:fname_out		name of the output file
 	Note that v:fname_in and v:fname_out will never be the same.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## cd


```lua
vim.opt.cdpath
```

 `'cdpath'`  `'cd'` 		string	(default: equivalent to $CDPATH or ",,")
 			global
 	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
 	|:cd|, |:tcd| and |:lcd| commands, provided that the directory being
 	searched for has a relative path, not an absolute part starting with
 	"/", "./" or "../", the `'cdpath'`  option is not used then.
 	The `'cdpath'`  option's value has the same form and semantics as
 	|`'path'` |.  Also see |file-searching|.
 	The default value is taken from $CDPATH, with a "," prepended to look
 	in the current directory first.
 	If the default value taken from $CDPATH is not what you want, include
 	a modified version of the following command in your vimrc file to
 	override it: >
 	  :let &cdpath = `','`  .. substitute(substitute($CDPATH, '[, ]', `'\\\0'` , `'g'` ), `':'` , `','` , `'g'` )
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.
 	(parts of `'cdpath'`  can be passed to the shell to expand file names).

## cdh


```lua
vim.opt.cdhome
```

 `'cdhome'`  `'cdh'` 		boolean	(default: off)
 			global
 	When on, |:cd|, |:tcd| and |:lcd| without an argument changes the
 	current working directory to the |$HOME| directory like in Unix.
 	When off, those commands just print the current directory name.
 	On Unix this option has no effect.

## cdhome


```lua
boolean
```

 `'cdhome'`  `'cdh'` 		boolean	(default: off)
 			global
 	When on, |:cd|, |:tcd| and |:lcd| without an argument changes the
 	current working directory to the |$HOME| directory like in Unix.
 	When off, those commands just print the current directory name.
 	On Unix this option has no effect.

## cdpath


```lua
string
```

 `'cdpath'`  `'cd'` 		string	(default: equivalent to $CDPATH or ",,")
 			global
 	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
 	|:cd|, |:tcd| and |:lcd| commands, provided that the directory being
 	searched for has a relative path, not an absolute part starting with
 	"/", "./" or "../", the `'cdpath'`  option is not used then.
 	The `'cdpath'`  option's value has the same form and semantics as
 	|`'path'` |.  Also see |file-searching|.
 	The default value is taken from $CDPATH, with a "," prepended to look
 	in the current directory first.
 	If the default value taken from $CDPATH is not what you want, include
 	a modified version of the following command in your vimrc file to
 	override it: >
 	  :let &cdpath = `','`  .. substitute(substitute($CDPATH, '[, ]', `'\\\0'` , `'g'` ), `':'` , `','` , `'g'` )
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.
 	(parts of `'cdpath'`  can be passed to the shell to expand file names).

## cedit


```lua
string
```

 `'cedit'` 			string	(default: CTRL-F)
 			global
 	The key used in Command-line Mode to open the command-line window.
 	Only non-printable keys are allowed.
 	The key can be specified as a single character, but it is difficult to
 	type.  The preferred way is to use the <> notation.  Examples: >
 		:exe "set cedit=\<C-Y>"
 		:exe "set cedit=\<Esc>"
 <	|Nvi| also has this option, but it only uses the first character.
 	See |cmdwin|.

## cf


```lua
vim.opt.confirm
```

 `'confirm'`  `'cf'` 		boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When `'confirm'`  is on, certain operations that would normally
 	fail because of unsaved changes to a buffer, e.g. ":q" and ":e",
 	instead raise a dialog asking if you wish to save the current
 	file(s).  You can still use a ! to unconditionally |abandon| a buffer.
 	If `'confirm'`  is off you can still activate confirmation for one
 	command only (this is most useful in mappings) with the |:confirm|
 	command.
 	Also see the |confirm()| function and the `'v'`  flag in `'guioptions'` .

## cfu


```lua
vim.opt.completefunc
```

 `'completefunc'`  `'cfu'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode completion
 	with CTRL-X CTRL-U. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|
 	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
 	invoked and what it should return.  The value can be the name of a
 	function, a |lambda| or a |Funcref|. See |option-value-function| for
 	more information.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## ch


```lua
vim.opt.cmdheight
```

 `'cmdheight'`  `'ch'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global or local to tab page
 	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line.  Helps avoiding
 	|hit-enter| prompts.
 	The value of this option is stored with the tab page, so that each tab
 	page can have a different value.
 
 	When `'cmdheight'`  is zero, there is no command-line unless it is being
 	used.  The command-line will cover the last line of the screen when
 	shown.
 
 	WARNING: `cmdheight=0` is considered experimental. Expect some
 	unwanted behaviour. Some `'shortmess'`  flags and similar
 	mechanism might fail to take effect, causing unwanted hit-enter
 	prompts.  Some informative messages, both from Nvim itself and
 	plugins, will not be displayed.

## channel


```lua
integer
```

 `'channel'` 		number (default: 0)
 			local to buffer
 	|channel| connected to the buffer, or 0 if no channel is connected.
 	In a |:terminal| buffer this is the terminal channel.
 	Read-only.

## charconvert


```lua
string
```

 `'charconvert'`  `'ccv'` 	string (default "")
 			global
 	An expression that is used for character encoding conversion.  It is
 	evaluated when a file that is to be read or has been written has a
 	different encoding from what is desired.
 	`'charconvert'`  is not used when the internal iconv() function is
 	supported and is able to do the conversion.  Using iconv() is
 	preferred, because it is much faster.
 	`'charconvert'`  is not used when reading stdin |--|, because there is no
 	file to convert from.  You will have to save the text in a file first.
 	The expression must return zero, false or an empty string for success,
 	non-zero or true for failure.
 	See |encoding-names| for possible encoding names.
 	Additionally, names given in `'fileencodings'`  and `'fileencoding'`  are
 	used.
 	Conversion between "latin1", "unicode", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" and "utf-8"
 	is done internally by Vim, `'charconvert'`  is not used for this.
 	Also used for Unicode conversion.
 	Example: >
 		set charconvert=CharConvert()
 		fun CharConvert()
 		  system("recode "
 			\ .. v:charconvert_from .. ".." .. v:charconvert_to
 			\ .. " <" .. v:fname_in .. " >" .. v:fname_out)
 		  return v:shell_error
 		endfun
 <	The related Vim variables are:
 		v:charconvert_from	name of the current encoding
 		v:charconvert_to	name of the desired encoding
 		v:fname_in		name of the input file
 		v:fname_out		name of the output file
 	Note that v:fname_in and v:fname_out will never be the same.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## ci


```lua
vim.opt.copyindent
```

 `'copyindent'`  `'ci'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Copy the structure of the existing lines indent when autoindenting a
 	new line.  Normally the new indent is reconstructed by a series of
 	tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |`'expandtab'` | is enabled,
 	in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option makes the
 	new line copy whatever characters were used for indenting on the
 	existing line.  `'expandtab'`  has no effect on these characters, a Tab
 	remains a Tab.  If the new indent is greater than on the existing
 	line, the remaining space is filled in the normal manner.
 	See `'preserveindent'` .

## cin


```lua
vim.opt.cindent
```

 `'cindent'`  `'cin'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Enables automatic C program indenting.  See `'cinkeys'`  to set the keys
 	that trigger reindenting in insert mode and `'cinoptions'`  to set your
 	preferred indent style.
 	If `'indentexpr'`  is not empty, it overrules `'cindent'` .
 	If `'lisp'`  is not on and both `'indentexpr'`  and `'equalprg'`  are empty,
 	the "=" operator indents using this algorithm rather than calling an
 	external program.
 	See |C-indenting|.
 	When you don't like the way `'cindent'`  works, try the `'smartindent'` 
 	option or `'indentexpr'` .

## cindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'cindent'`  `'cin'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Enables automatic C program indenting.  See `'cinkeys'`  to set the keys

 	preferred indent style.
 	If `'indentexpr'`  is not empty, it overrules `'cindent'` .
 	If `'lisp'`  is not on and both `'indentexpr'`  and `'equalprg'`  are empty,
 	the "=" operator indents using this algorithm rather than calling an
 	external program.
 	See |C-indenting|.

```

 `'cinkeys'`  `'cink'` 	string	(default "0{,0},0),0],:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
 			local to buffer
 	A list of keys that, when typed in Insert mode, cause reindenting of
 	the current line.  Only used if `'cindent'`  is on and `'indentexpr'`  is
 	empty.
 	For the format of this option see |cinkeys-format|.
 	See |C-indenting|.

 	See |C-indenting|.

## cino


```lua
vim.opt.cinoptions
```

 `'cinoptions'`  `'cino'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	The `'cinoptions'`  affect the way `'cindent'`  reindents lines in a C
 	program.  See |cinoptions-values| for the values of this option, and
 	|C-indenting| for info on C indenting in general.

## cinoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'cinoptions'`  `'cino'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	The `'cinoptions'`  affect the way `'cindent'`  reindents lines in a C
 	program.  See |cinoptions-values| for the values of this option, and
 	|C-indenting| for info on C indenting in general.

## cinscopedecls


```lua
string
```

 `'cinscopedecls'`  `'cinsd'` 	string	(default "public,protected,private")
 			local to buffer
 	Keywords that are interpreted as a C++ scope declaration by |cino-g|.
 	Useful e.g. for working with the Qt framework that defines additional
 	scope declarations "signals", "public slots" and "private slots": >
 		set cinscopedecls+=signals,public\ slots,private\ slots
 
 <

## cinsd


```lua

 `'cinscopedecls'`  `'cinsd'` 	string	(default "public,protected,private")
 			local to buffer
 	Keywords that are interpreted as a C++ scope declaration by |cino-g|.
 	Useful e.g. for working with the Qt framework that defines additional
 	scope declarations "signals", "public slots" and "private slots": >
 		set cinscopedecls+=signals,public\ slots,private\ slots
 
 <

## cinw


```lua
vim.opt.cinwords
```

 `'cinwords'`  `'cinw'` 	string	(default "if,else,while,do,for,switch")
 			local to buffer
 	These keywords start an extra indent in the next line when
 	`'smartindent'`  or `'cindent'`  is set.  For `'cindent'`  this is only done at
 	an appropriate place (inside {}).
 	Note that `'ignorecase'`  isn't used for `'cinwords'` .  If case doesn't
 	matter, include the keyword both the uppercase and lowercase:
 	"if,If,IF".

## cinwords


```lua
string
```

 `'cinwords'`  `'cinw'` 	string	(default "if,else,while,do,for,switch")
 			local to buffer
 	These keywords start an extra indent in the next line when
 	`'smartindent'`  or `'cindent'`  is set.  For `'cindent'`  this is only done at
 	an appropriate place (inside {}).
 	Note that `'ignorecase'`  isn't used for `'cinwords'` .  If case doesn't
 	matter, include the keyword both the uppercase and lowercase:
 	"if,If,IF".

## clipboard


```lua
string
```

 `'clipboard'`  `'cb'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This option is a list of comma-separated names.
 	These names are recognized:
 
 
 	unnamed		When included, Vim will use the clipboard register "*"
 			for all yank, delete, change and put operations which
 			would normally go to the unnamed register.  When a
 			register is explicitly specified, it will always be
 			used regardless of whether "unnamed" is in `'clipboard'` 
 			or not.  The clipboard register can always be
 			explicitly accessed using the "* notation.  Also see
 			|clipboard|.
 
 
 	unnamedplus	A variant of the "unnamed" flag which uses the
 			clipboard register "+" (|quoteplus|) instead of
 			register "*" for all yank, delete, change and put
 			operations which would normally go to the unnamed
 			register.  When "unnamed" is also included to the
 			option, yank and delete operations (but not put)
 			will additionally copy the text into register
 			`'*'` . See |clipboard|.

## cmdheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'cmdheight'`  `'ch'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global or local to tab page
 	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line.  Helps avoiding
 	|hit-enter| prompts.
 	The value of this option is stored with the tab page, so that each tab
 	page can have a different value.
 
 	When `'cmdheight'`  is zero, there is no command-line unless it is being
 	used.  The command-line will cover the last line of the screen when
 	shown.
 
 	WARNING: `cmdheight=0` is considered experimental. Expect some
 	unwanted behaviour. Some `'shortmess'`  flags and similar
 	mechanism might fail to take effect, causing unwanted hit-enter
 	prompts.  Some informative messages, both from Nvim itself and
 	plugins, will not be displayed.

## cmdwinheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'cmdwinheight'`  `'cwh'` 	number	(default 7)
 			global
 	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line window. |cmdwin|

## cmp


```lua
vim.opt.casemap
```

 `'casemap'`  `'cmp'` 		string	(default: "internal,keepascii")
 			global
 	Specifies details about changing the case of letters.  It may contain
 	these words, separated by a comma:
 	internal	Use internal case mapping functions, the current
 			locale does not change the case mapping. When
 			"internal" is omitted, the towupper() and towlower()
 			system library functions are used when available.
 	keepascii	For the ASCII characters (0x00 to 0x7f) use the US
 			case mapping, the current locale is not effective.
 			This probably only matters for Turkish.

## cms


```lua
vim.opt.commentstring
```

 `'commentstring'`  `'cms'` 	string	(default "//")
 			local to buffer
 	A template for a comment.  The "%s" in the value is replaced with the
 	comment text.  Currently only used to add markers for folding, see
 	|fold-marker|.

## co


```lua
vim.opt.columns
```

 `'columns'`  `'co'` 		number	(default 80 or terminal width)
 			global
 	Number of columns of the screen.  Normally this is set by the terminal
 	initialization and does not have to be set by hand.
 	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
 	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
 	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |ginit.vim| file.
 	When you set this option and Vim is unable to change the physical
 	number of columns of the display, the display may be messed up.  For
 	the GUI it is always possible and Vim limits the number of columns to
 	what fits on the screen.  You can use this command to get the widest
 	window possible: >
 		:set columns=9999
 <	Minimum value is 12, maximum value is 10000.

## cocu


```lua
vim.opt.concealcursor
```

 `'concealcursor'`  `'cocu'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to window
 	Sets the modes in which text in the cursor line can also be concealed.
 	When the current mode is listed then concealing happens just like in
 	other lines.
 	  n		Normal mode
 	  v		Visual mode
 	  i		Insert mode
 	  c		Command line editing, for `'incsearch'` 
 
 	`'v'`  applies to all lines in the Visual area, not only the cursor.
 	A useful value is "nc".  This is used in help files.  So long as you
 	are moving around text is concealed, but when starting to insert text
 	or selecting a Visual area the concealed text is displayed, so that
 	you can see what you are doing.
 	Keep in mind that the cursor position is not always where it's
 	displayed.  E.g., when moving vertically it may change column.

## cole


```lua
vim.opt.conceallevel
```

 `'conceallevel'`  `'cole'` 	number (default 0)
 			local to window
 	Determine how text with the "conceal" syntax attribute |:syn-conceal|
 	is shown:
 
 	Value		Effect ~
 	0		Text is shown normally
 	1		Each block of concealed text is replaced with one
 			character.  If the syntax item does not have a custom
 			replacement character defined (see |:syn-cchar|) the
 			character defined in `'listchars'`  is used.
 			It is highlighted with the "Conceal" highlight group.
 	2		Concealed text is completely hidden unless it has a
 			custom replacement character defined (see
 			|:syn-cchar|).
 	3		Concealed text is completely hidden.
 
 	Note: in the cursor line concealed text is not hidden, so that you can
 	edit and copy the text.  This can be changed with the `'concealcursor'` 
 	option.

## colorcolumn


```lua
string
```

 `'colorcolumn'`  `'cc'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to window
 	`'colorcolumn'`  is a comma-separated list of screen columns that are
 	highlighted with ColorColumn |hl-ColorColumn|.  Useful to align
 	text.  Will make screen redrawing slower.
 	The screen column can be an absolute number, or a number preceded with
 	`'+'`  or `'-'` , which is added to or subtracted from `'textwidth'` . >
 
 		:set cc=+1  " highlight column after `'textwidth'` 
 		:set cc=+1,+2,+3  " highlight three columns after `'textwidth'` 
 		:hi ColorColumn ctermbg=lightgrey guibg=lightgrey
 <
 	When `'textwidth'`  is zero then the items with `'-'`  and `'+'`  are not used.
 	A maximum of 256 columns are highlighted.

## columns


```lua
integer
```

 `'columns'`  `'co'` 		number	(default 80 or terminal width)
 			global
 	Number of columns of the screen.  Normally this is set by the terminal
 	initialization and does not have to be set by hand.
 	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
 	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want

```

 `'comments'`  `'com'` 	string	(default
 				"s1:/,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-")
 			local to buffer
 	A comma-separated list of strings that can start a comment line.  See
 	|format-comments|.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes to

 `'comments'`  `'com'` 	string	(default
 				"s1:/,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-")
 			local to buffer
 	A comma-separated list of strings that can start a comment line.  See
 	|format-comments|.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes to
 	insert a space.

## commentstring


```lua
string
```

 `'commentstring'`  `'cms'` 	string	(default "//")
 			local to buffer
 	A template for a comment.  The "%s" in the value is replaced with the
 	comment text.  Currently only used to add markers for folding, see
 	|fold-marker|.

## compatible


```lua
boolean
```

## complete


```lua
string
```

 `'complete'`  `'cpt'` 	string	(default: ".,w,b,u,t")
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies how keyword completion |ins-completion| works
 	when CTRL-P or CTRL-N are used.  It is also used for whole-line
 	completion |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L|.  It indicates the type of completion
 	and the places to scan.  It is a comma-separated list of flags:
 	.	scan the current buffer (`'wrapscan'`  is ignored)
 	w	scan buffers from other windows
 	b	scan other loaded buffers that are in the buffer list
 	u	scan the unloaded buffers that are in the buffer list
 	U	scan the buffers that are not in the buffer list
 	k	scan the files given with the `'dictionary'`  option
 	kspell  use the currently active spell checking |spell|
 	k{dict}	scan the file {dict}.  Several "k" flags can be given,
 		patterns are valid too.  For example: >
 			:set cpt=k/usr/dict/*,k~/spanish
 <	s	scan the files given with the `'thesaurus'`  option
 	s{tsr}	scan the file {tsr}.  Several "s" flags can be given, patterns
 		are valid too.
 	i	scan current and included files
 	d	scan current and included files for defined name or macro
 		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D|
 	]	tag completion
 	t	same as "]"
 
 	Unloaded buffers are not loaded, thus their autocmds |:autocmd| are
 	not executed, this may lead to unexpected completions from some files
 	(gzipped files for example).  Unloaded buffers are not scanned for
 	whole-line completion.
 
 	As you can see, CTRL-N and CTRL-P can be used to do any `'iskeyword'` -
 	based expansion (e.g., dictionary |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|, included patterns
 	|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I|, tags |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]| and normal expansions).

## completefunc


```lua
string
```

 `'completefunc'`  `'cfu'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode completion
 	with CTRL-X CTRL-U. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|
 	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
 	invoked and what it should return.  The value can be the name of a
 	function, a |lambda| or a |Funcref|. See |option-value-function| for
 	more information.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## completeopt


```lua
string
```

 `'completeopt'`  `'cot'` 	string	(default: "menu,preview")
 			global
 	A comma-separated list of options for Insert mode completion
 	|ins-completion|.  The supported values are:
 
 	   menu	    Use a popup menu to show the possible completions.  The
 		    menu is only shown when there is more than one match and
 		    sufficient colors are available.  |ins-completion-menu|
 
 	   menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
 		    Useful when there is additional information about the
 		    match, e.g., what file it comes from.
 
 	   longest  Only insert the longest common text of the matches.  If
 		    the menu is displayed you can use CTRL-L to add more
 		    characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
 		    of completion.  For buffer text the `'ignorecase'`  option is
 		    used.
 
 	   preview  Show extra information about the currently selected
 		    completion in the preview window.  Only works in
 		    combination with "menu" or "menuone".
 
 	  noinsert  Do not insert any text for a match until the user selects
 		    a match from the menu. Only works in combination with
 		    "menu" or "menuone". No effect if "longest" is present.
 
 	  noselect  Do not select a match in the menu, force the user to
 		    select one from the menu. Only works in combination with
 		    "menu" or "menuone".

## completeslash


```lua
string
```

 `'completeslash'`  `'csl'` 	string	(default: "")
 			local to buffer
 			{only for MS-Windows}
 	When this option is set it overrules `'shellslash'`  for completion:
 	- When this option is set to "slash", a forward slash is used for path
 	  completion in insert mode. This is useful when editing HTML tag, or
 	  Makefile with `'noshellslash'`  on MS-Windows.
 	- When this option is set to "backslash", backslash is used. This is
 	  useful when editing a batch file with `'shellslash'`  set on MS-Windows.
 	- When this option is empty, same character is used as for
 	  `'shellslash'` .
 	For Insert mode completion the buffer-local value is used.  For
 	command line completion the global value is used.

## concealcursor


```lua
string
```

 `'concealcursor'`  `'cocu'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to window
 	Sets the modes in which text in the cursor line can also be concealed.
 	When the current mode is listed then concealing happens just like in
 	other lines.
 	  n		Normal mode
 	  v		Visual mode
 	  i		Insert mode
 	  c		Command line editing, for `'incsearch'` 
 
 	`'v'`  applies to all lines in the Visual area, not only the cursor.
 	A useful value is "nc".  This is used in help files.  So long as you
 	are moving around text is concealed, but when starting to insert text
 	or selecting a Visual area the concealed text is displayed, so that
 	you can see what you are doing.
 	Keep in mind that the cursor position is not always where it's
 	displayed.  E.g., when moving vertically it may change column.

## conceallevel


```lua
integer
```

 `'conceallevel'`  `'cole'` 	number (default 0)
 			local to window
 	Determine how text with the "conceal" syntax attribute |:syn-conceal|
 	is shown:
 
 	Value		Effect ~
 	0		Text is shown normally
 	1		Each block of concealed text is replaced with one
 			character.  If the syntax item does not have a custom
 			replacement character defined (see |:syn-cchar|) the
 			character defined in `'listchars'`  is used.
 			It is highlighted with the "Conceal" highlight group.
 	2		Concealed text is completely hidden unless it has a
 			custom replacement character defined (see
 			|:syn-cchar|).
 	3		Concealed text is completely hidden.
 
 	Note: in the cursor line concealed text is not hidden, so that you can
 	edit and copy the text.  This can be changed with the `'concealcursor'` 
 	option.

## confirm


```lua
boolean
```

 `'confirm'`  `'cf'` 		boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When `'confirm'`  is on, certain operations that would normally
 	fail because of unsaved changes to a buffer, e.g. ":q" and ":e",
 	instead raise a dialog asking if you wish to save the current
 	file(s).  You can still use a ! to unconditionally |abandon| a buffer.
 	If `'confirm'`  is off you can still activate confirmation for one
 	command only (this is most useful in mappings) with the |:confirm|
 	command.
 	Also see the |confirm()| function and the `'v'`  flag in `'guioptions'` .

## copyindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'copyindent'`  `'ci'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Copy the structure of the existing lines indent when autoindenting a
 	new line.  Normally the new indent is reconstructed by a series of
 	tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |`'expandtab'` | is enabled,
 	in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option makes the
 	new line copy whatever characters were used for indenting on the
 	existing line.  `'expandtab'`  has no effect on these characters, a Tab
 	remains a Tab.  If the new indent is greater than on the existing
 	line, the remaining space is filled in the normal manner.
 	See `'preserveindent'` .

## cot


```lua
vim.opt.completeopt
```

 `'completeopt'`  `'cot'` 	string	(default: "menu,preview")
 			global
 	A comma-separated list of options for Insert mode completion
 	|ins-completion|.  The supported values are:
 
 	   menu	    Use a popup menu to show the possible completions.  The
 		    menu is only shown when there is more than one match and
 		    sufficient colors are available.  |ins-completion-menu|
 
 	   menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
 		    Useful when there is additional information about the
 		    match, e.g., what file it comes from.
 
 	   longest  Only insert the longest common text of the matches.  If
 		    the menu is displayed you can use CTRL-L to add more
 		    characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
 		    of completion.  For buffer text the `'ignorecase'`  option is
 		    used.
 
 	   preview  Show extra information about the currently selected
 		    completion in the preview window.  Only works in
 		    combination with "menu" or "menuone".
 
 	  noinsert  Do not insert any text for a match until the user selects
 		    a match from the menu. Only works in combination with
 		    "menu" or "menuone". No effect if "longest" is present.
 
 	  noselect  Do not select a match in the menu, force the user to
 		    select one from the menu. Only works in combination with
 		    "menu" or "menuone".

## cp


```lua
vim.opt.compatible
```

## cpo


```lua
vim.opt.cpoptions
```

 `'cpoptions'`  `'cpo'` 	string	(default: "aABceFs_")
 			global
 	A sequence of single character flags.  When a character is present
 	this indicates Vi-compatible behavior.  This is used for things where
 	not being Vi-compatible is mostly or sometimes preferred.
 	`'cpoptions'`  stands for "compatible-options".
 	Commas can be added for readability.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
 
 	    contains	behavior	~
 
 		a	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
 			argument will set the alternate file name for the
 			current window.
 
 		A	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
 			argument will set the alternate file name for the
 			current window.
 
 		b	"\|" in a ":map" command is recognized as the end of
 			the map command.  The `'\'`  is included in the mapping,
 			the text after the `'|'`  is interpreted as the next
 			command.  Use a CTRL-V instead of a backslash to
 			include the `'|'`  in the mapping.  Applies to all
 			mapping, abbreviation, menu and autocmd commands.
 			See also |map_bar|.
 
 		B	A backslash has no special meaning in mappings,
 			abbreviations, user commands and the "to" part of the
 			menu commands.  Remove this flag to be able to use a
 			backslash like a CTRL-V.  For example, the command
 			":map X \<Esc>" results in X being mapped to:
 				`'B'`  included:	"\^["	 (^[ is a real <Esc>)
 				`'B'`  excluded:	"<Esc>"  (5 characters)
 
 		c	Searching continues at the end of any match at the
 			cursor position, but not further than the start of the
 			next line.  When not present searching continues
 			one character from the cursor position.  With `'c'` 
 			"abababababab" only gets three matches when repeating
 			"/abab", without `'c'`  there are five matches.
 
 		C	Do not concatenate sourced lines that start with a
 			backslash.  See |line-continuation|.
 
 		d	Using "./" in the `'tags'`  option doesn't mean to use
 			the tags file relative to the current file, but the
 			tags file in the current directory.
 
 		D	Can't use CTRL-K to enter a digraph after Normal mode
 			commands with a character argument, like |r|, |f| and
 			|t|.
 
 		e	When executing a register with ":@r", always add a
 			<CR> to the last line, also when the register is not
 			linewise.  If this flag is not present, the register
 			is not linewise and the last line does not end in a
 			<CR>, then the last line is put on the command-line
 			and can be edited before hitting <CR>.
 
 		E	It is an error when using "y", "d", "c", "g~", "gu" or
 			"gU" on an Empty region.  The operators only work when
 			at least one character is to be operated on.  Example:
 			This makes "y0" fail in the first column.
 
 		f	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
 			argument will set the file name for the current buffer,
 			if the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet.
 
 		F	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
 			argument will set the file name for the current
 			buffer, if the current buffer doesn't have a file name
 			yet.  Also see |cpo-P|.
 
 		i	When included, interrupting the reading of a file will
 			leave it modified.
 
 		I	When moving the cursor up or down just after inserting
 			indent for `'autoindent'` , do not delete the indent.
 
 		J	A |sentence| has to be followed by two spaces after
 			the `'.'` , `'!'`  or `'?'` .  A <Tab> is not recognized as
 			white space.
 
 		K	Don't wait for a key code to complete when it is
 			halfway through a mapping.  This breaks mapping
 			<F1><F1> when only part of the second <F1> has been
 			read.  It enables cancelling the mapping by typing
 			<F1><Esc>.
 
 		l	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
 			literally, only "\]", "\^", "\-" and "\\" are special.
 			See |/[]|
 			   `'l'`  included: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space>, `'\'`  and `'t'` 
 			   `'l'`  excluded: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space> and <Tab>
 
 		L	When the `'list'`  option is set, `'wrapmargin'` ,
 			`'textwidth'` , `'softtabstop'`  and Virtual Replace mode
 			(see |gR|) count a <Tab> as two characters, instead of
 			the normal behavior of a <Tab>.
 
 		m	When included, a showmatch will always wait half a
 			second.  When not included, a showmatch will wait half
 			a second or until a character is typed.  |`'showmatch'` |
 
 		M	When excluded, "%" matching will take backslashes into
 			account.  Thus in "( \( )" and "\( ( \)" the outer
 			parenthesis match.  When included "%" ignores
 			backslashes, which is Vi compatible.
 
 		n	When included, the column used for `'number'`  and
 			`'relativenumber'`  will also be used for text of wrapped
 			lines.
 
 		o	Line offset to search command is not remembered for
 			next search.
 
 		O	Don't complain if a file is being overwritten, even
 			when it didn't exist when editing it.  This is a
 			protection against a file unexpectedly created by
 			someone else.  Vi didn't complain about this.
 
 		p	Vi compatible Lisp indenting.  When not present, a
 			slightly better algorithm is used.
 
 		P	When included, a ":write" command that appends to a
 			file will set the file name for the current buffer, if
 			the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet and
 			the `'F'`  flag is also included |cpo-F|.
 
 		q	When joining multiple lines leave the cursor at the
 			position where it would be when joining two lines.
 
 		r	Redo ("." command) uses "/" to repeat a search
 			command, instead of the actually used search string.
 
 		R	Remove marks from filtered lines.  Without this flag
 			marks are kept like |:keepmarks| was used.
 
 		s	Set buffer options when entering the buffer for the
 			first time.  This is like it is in Vim version 3.0.
 			And it is the default.  If not present the options are
 			set when the buffer is created.
 
 		S	Set buffer options always when entering a buffer
 			(except `'readonly'` , `'fileformat'` , `'filetype'`  and
 			`'syntax'` ).  This is the (most) Vi compatible setting.
 			The options are set to the values in the current
 			buffer.  When you change an option and go to another
 			buffer, the value is copied.  Effectively makes the
 			buffer options global to all buffers.
 
 			`'s'`     `'S'`      copy buffer options
 			no     no      when buffer created
 			yes    no      when buffer first entered (default)
 			 X     yes     each time when buffer entered (vi comp.)
 
 		t	Search pattern for the tag command is remembered for
 			"n" command.  Otherwise Vim only puts the pattern in
 			the history for search pattern, but doesn't change the
 			last used search pattern.
 
 		u	Undo is Vi compatible.  See |undo-two-ways|.
 
 		v	Backspaced characters remain visible on the screen in
 			Insert mode.  Without this flag the characters are
 			erased from the screen right away.  With this flag the
 			screen newly typed text overwrites backspaced
 			characters.
 
 		W	Don't overwrite a readonly file.  When omitted, ":w!"
 			overwrites a readonly file, if possible.
 
 		x	<Esc> on the command-line executes the command-line.
 			The default in Vim is to abandon the command-line,
 			because <Esc> normally aborts a command.  |c_<Esc>|
 
 		X	When using a count with "R" the replaced text is
 			deleted only once.  Also when repeating "R" with "."
 			and a count.
 
 		y	A yank command can be redone with ".".  Think twice if
 			you really want to use this, it may break some
 			plugins, since most people expect "." to only repeat a
 			change.
 
 		Z	When using "w!" while the `'readonly'`  option is set,
 			don't reset `'readonly'` .
 
 		!	When redoing a filter command, use the last used
 			external command, whatever it was.  Otherwise the last
 			used -filter- command is used.
 
 		$	When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the
 			line, but put a `'$'`  at the end of the changed text.
 			The changed text will be overwritten when you type the
 			new text.  The line is redisplayed if you type any
 			command that moves the cursor from the insertion
 			point.
 
 		%	Vi-compatible matching is done for the "%" command.
 			Does not recognize "#if", "#endif", etc.
 			Does not recognize "/*" and "*/".
 			Parens inside single and double quotes are also
 			counted, causing a string that contains a paren to
 			disturb the matching.  For example, in a line like
 			"if (strcmp("foo(", s))" the first paren does not
 			match the last one.  When this flag is not included,
 			parens inside single and double quotes are treated
 			specially.  When matching a paren outside of quotes,
 			everything inside quotes is ignored.  When matching a
 			paren inside quotes, it will find the matching one (if
 			there is one).  This works very well for C programs.
 			This flag is also used for other features, such as
 			C-indenting.
 
 		+	When included, a ":write file" command will reset the
 			`'modified'`  flag of the buffer, even though the buffer
 			itself may still be different from its file.
 
 		>	When appending to a register, put a line break before
 			the appended text.
 
 		;	When using |,| or |;| to repeat the last |t| search
 			and the cursor is right in front of the searched
 			character, the cursor won't move. When not included,
 			the cursor would skip over it and jump to the
 			following occurrence.
 
 		_	When using |cw| on a word, do not include the
 			whitespace following the word in the motion.

 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies how keyword completion |ins-completion| works
 	when CTRL-P or CTRL-N are used.  It is also used for whole-line
 	completion |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L|.  It indicates the type of completion
 	and the places to scan.  It is a comma-separated list of flags:
 	.	scan the current buffer (`'wrapscan'`  is ignored)
 	w	scan buffers from other windows
 	b	scan other loaded buffers that are in the buffer list
 	u	scan the unloaded buffers that are in the buffer list
 	U	scan the buffers that are not in the buffer list
 	k	scan the files given with the `'dictionary'`  option
 	kspell  use the currently active spell checking |spell|
 	k{dict}	scan the file {dict}.  Several "k" flags can be given,
 		patterns are valid too.  For example: >
 			:set cpt=k/usr/dict/*,k~/spanish
 <	s	scan the files given with the `'thesaurus'`  option
 	s{tsr}	scan the file {tsr}.  Several "s" flags can be given, patterns
 		are valid too.
 	i	scan current and included files
 	d	scan current and included files for defined name or macro
 		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D|
 	]	tag completion
 	t	same as "]"
 
 	Unloaded buffers are not loaded, thus their autocmds |:autocmd| are
 	not executed, this may lead to unexpected completions from some files
 	(gzipped files for example).  Unloaded buffers are not scanned for
 	whole-line completion.
 
 	As you can see, CTRL-N and CTRL-P can be used to do any `'iskeyword'` -
 	based expansion (e.g., dictionary |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|, included patterns
 	|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I|, tags |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]| and normal expansions).

 `'cursorbind'`  `'crb'` 	boolean  (default off)
 			local to window
 	When this option is set, as the cursor in the current
 	window moves other cursorbound windows (windows that also have
 	this option set) move their cursors to the corresponding line and
 	column.  This option is useful for viewing the
 	differences between two versions of a file (see `'diff'` ); in diff mode,
 	inserted and deleted lines (though not characters within a line) are
 	taken into account.

## csl


```lua
vim.opt.completeslash
```

 `'completeslash'`  `'csl'` 	string	(default: "")
 			local to buffer
 			{only for MS-Windows}
 	When this option is set it overrules `'shellslash'`  for completion:
 	- When this option is set to "slash", a forward slash is used for path
 	  completion in insert mode. This is useful when editing HTML tag, or
 	  Makefile with `'noshellslash'`  on MS-Windows.
 	- When this option is set to "backslash", backslash is used. This is
 	  useful when editing a batch file with `'shellslash'`  set on MS-Windows.
 	- When this option is empty, same character is used as for
 	  `'shellslash'` .
 	For Insert mode completion the buffer-local value is used.  For
 	command line completion the global value is used.

## cuc


```lua
vim.opt.cursorcolumn
```

 `'cursorcolumn'`  `'cuc'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Highlight the screen column of the cursor with CursorColumn
 	|hl-CursorColumn|.  Useful to align text.  Will make screen redrawing
 	slower.
 	If you only want the highlighting in the current window you can use
 	these autocommands: >
 		au WinLeave * set nocursorline nocursorcolumn
 		au WinEnter * set cursorline cursorcolumn
 <

## cul


```lua
vim.opt.cursorline
```

 `'cursorline'`  `'cul'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Highlight the text line of the cursor with CursorLine |hl-CursorLine|.
 	Useful to easily spot the cursor.  Will make screen redrawing slower.
 	When Visual mode is active the highlighting isn't used to make it
 	easier to see the selected text.

## culopt


```lua
vim.opt.cursorlineopt
```

 `'cursorlineopt'`  `'culopt'`  string (default: "number,line")
 			local to window
 	Comma-separated list of settings for how `'cursorline'`  is displayed.
 	Valid values:
 	"line"		Highlight the text line of the cursor with
 			CursorLine |hl-CursorLine|.
 	"screenline"	Highlight only the screen line of the cursor with
 			CursorLine |hl-CursorLine|.
 	"number"	Highlight the line number of the cursor with
 			CursorLineNr |hl-CursorLineNr|.
 
 	Special value:
 	"both"		Alias for the values "line,number".
 
 	"line" and "screenline" cannot be used together.

 	These values can be used:
 	msg	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
 		anyway.
 	throw	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
 		anyway and also throw an exception and set |v:errmsg|.
 	beep	A message will be given when otherwise only a beep would be
 		produced.
 	The values can be combined, separated by a comma.
 	"msg" and "throw" are useful for debugging `'foldexpr'` , `'formatexpr'`  or
 	`'indentexpr'` .

## deco


```lua
vim.opt.delcombine
```

 `'delcombine'`  `'deco'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	If editing Unicode and this option is set, backspace and Normal mode
 	"x" delete each combining character on its own.  When it is off (the
 	default) the character along with its combining characters are
 	deleted.
 	Note: When `'delcombine'`  is set "xx" may work differently from "2x"!
 
 	This is useful for Arabic, Hebrew and many other languages where one
 	may have combining characters overtop of base characters, and want
 	to remove only the combining ones.

## def


```lua
vim.opt.define
```

 `'define'`  `'def'` 		string	(default "^\sdefine")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Pattern to be used to find a macro definition.  It is a search
 	pattern, just like for the "/" command.  This option is used for the
 	commands like "[i" and "[d" |include-search|.  The `'isident'`  option is
 	used to recognize the defined name after the match:
 		{match with `'define'` }{non-ID chars}{defined name}{non-ID char}
 	See |option-backslash| about inserting backslashes to include a space
 	or backslash.
 	The default value is for C programs.  For C++ this value would be
 	useful, to include const type declarations: >
 		^\(#\s\s[a-z]*\)
 <	You can also use "\ze" just before the name and continue the pattern
 	to check what is following.  E.g. for Javascript, if a function is
 	defined with `func_name = function(args)`: >
 		^\s=\s*function(
 <	If the function is defined with `func_name : function() {...`: >
 	        ^\s[:]\sfunction\s*(
 <	When using the ":set" command, you need to double the backslashes!
 	To avoid that use `:let` with a single quote string: >
 		let &l:define = `'^\s=\s*function('`

 	{char2}.  See |digraphs|.

## dict


```lua
vim.opt.dictionary
```

 `'dictionary'`  `'dict'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
 	for keyword completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|.  Each file should
 	contain a list of words.  This can be one word per line, or several
 	words per line, separated by non-keyword characters (white space is
 	preferred).  Maximum line length is 510 bytes.
 
 	When this option is empty or an entry "spell" is present, and spell
 	checking is enabled, words in the word lists for the currently active
 	`'spelllang'`  are used. See |spell|.
 
 	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
 	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
 	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
 	This has nothing to do with the |Dictionary| variable type.
 	Where to find a list of words?
 	- BSD/macOS include the "/usr/share/dict/words" file.
 	- Try "apt install spell" to get the "/usr/share/dict/words" file on
 	  apt-managed systems (Debian/Ubuntu).
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.
 	Backticks cannot be used in this option for security reasons.

## diffopt


```lua
string
```

 `'diffopt'`  `'dip'` 		string	(default "internal,filler,closeoff")
 			global
 	Option settings for diff mode.  It can consist of the following items.
 	All are optional.  Items must be separated by a comma.
 
 		filler		Show filler lines, to keep the text
 				synchronized with a window that has inserted
 				lines at the same position.  Mostly useful
 				when windows are side-by-side and `'scrollbind'` 
 				is set.
 
 		context:{n}	Use a context of {n} lines between a change
 				and a fold that contains unchanged lines.
 				When omitted a context of six lines is used.
 				When using zero the context is actually one,
 				since folds require a line in between, also
 				for a deleted line.
 				See |fold-diff|.
 
 		iblank		Ignore changes where lines are all blank.  Adds
 				the "-B" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.
 				NOTE: the diff windows will get out of sync,
 				because no differences between blank lines are
 				taken into account.
 
 		icase		Ignore changes in case of text.  "a" and "A"
 				are considered the same.  Adds the "-i" flag
 				to the "diff" command if `'diffexpr'`  is empty.
 
 		iwhite		Ignore changes in amount of white space.  Adds
 				the "-b" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.  It should ignore adding trailing
 				white space, but not leading white space.
 
 		iwhiteall	Ignore all white space changes.  Adds
 				the "-w" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.
 
 		iwhiteeol	Ignore white space changes at end of line.
 				Adds the "-Z" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.
 
 		horizontal	Start diff mode with horizontal splits (unless
 				explicitly specified otherwise).
 
 		vertical	Start diff mode with vertical splits (unless
 				explicitly specified otherwise).
 
 		closeoff	When a window is closed where `'diff'`  is set
 				and there is only one window remaining in the
 				same tab page with `'diff'`  set, execute
 				`:diffoff` in that window.  This undoes a
 				`:diffsplit` command.
 
 		hiddenoff	Do not use diff mode for a buffer when it
 				becomes hidden.
 
 		foldcolumn:{n}	Set the `'foldcolumn'`  option to {n} when
 				starting diff mode.  Without this 2 is used.
 
 		followwrap	Follow the `'wrap'`  option and leave as it is.
 
 		internal	Use the internal diff library.  This is
 				ignored when `'diffexpr'`  is set.
 				When running out of memory when writing a
 				buffer this item will be ignored for diffs
 				involving that buffer.  Set the `'verbose'` 
 				option to see when this happens.
 
 		indent-heuristic
 				Use the indent heuristic for the internal
 				diff library.
 
 		linematch:{n}   Enable a second stage diff on each generated
 				hunk in order to align lines. When the total
 				number of lines in a hunk exceeds {n}, the
 				second stage diff will not be performed as
 				very large hunks can cause noticeable lag. A
 				recommended setting is "linematch:60", as this
 				will enable alignment for a 2 buffer diff with
 				hunks of up to 30 lines each, or a 3 buffer
 				diff with hunks of up to 20 lines each.
 
                 algorithm:{text} Use the specified diff algorithm with the
 				internal diff engine. Currently supported
 				algorithms are:
 				myers      the default algorithm
 				minimal    spend extra time to generate the
 					   smallest possible diff
 				patience   patience diff algorithm
 				histogram  histogram diff algorithm

## dir


```lua
vim.opt.directory
```

 `'directory'`  `'dir'` 	string	(default "$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/swap//")
 			global
 	List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.
 
 	Possible items:
 	- The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
 	  possible.  If it is not possible in any directory, but last
 	  directory listed in the option does not exist, it is created.
 	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
 	  impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
 	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
 	  the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading "."
 	  is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
 	  with all path separators replaced by percent `'%'`  signs (including
 	  the colon following the drive letter on Win32). This will ensure
 	  file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
 	  use `'//'` , instead of `'\\'` .
 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
 	- A directory name may end in an `':'`  or `'/'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type one before a space, type two to
 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
 	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
 <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a `'>'`  at the start
 	  of the option is removed.
 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
 	choice than "/tmp".  But others on the computer may be able to see the
 	files, and it can contain a lot of files, your swap files get lost in
 	the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your home directory is
 	tried first.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
 	- A directory name may end in an `':'`  or `'/'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type one before a space, type two to
 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
 	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
 <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a `'>'`  at the start
 	  of the option is removed.
 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
 	choice than "/tmp".  But others on the computer may be able to see the
 	files, and it can contain a lot of files, your swap files get lost in
 	the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your home directory is
 	tried first.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## display


```lua
string
```

 `'display'`  `'dy'` 		string	(default "lastline")
 			global
 	Change the way text is displayed.  This is a comma-separated list of
 	flags:
 	lastline	When included, as much as possible of the last line
 			in a window will be displayed.  "@@@" is put in the
 			last columns of the last screen line to indicate the
 			rest of the line is not displayed.
 	truncate	Like "lastline", but "@@@" is displayed in the first
 			column of the last screen line.  Overrules "lastline".
 	uhex		Show unprintable characters hexadecimal as <xx>
 			instead of using ^C and ~C.
 	msgsep		Obsolete flag. Allowed but takes no effect. |msgsep|
 
 	When neither "lastline" nor "truncate" is included, a last line that
 	doesn't fit is replaced with "@" lines.
 
 	The "@" character can be changed by setting the "lastline" item in
 	`'fillchars'` .  The character is highlighted with |hl-NonText|.

## dy


```lua
vim.opt.display

## ea


```lua
vim.opt.equalalways
```

 `'equalalways'`  `'ea'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, all the windows are automatically made the same size after
 	splitting or closing a window.  This also happens the moment the
 	option is switched on.  When off, splitting a window will reduce the
 	size of the current window and leave the other windows the same.  When
 	closing a window the extra lines are given to the window next to it
 	(depending on `'splitbelow'`  and `'splitright'` ).
 	When mixing vertically and horizontally split windows, a minimal size
 	is computed and some windows may be larger if there is room.  The
 	`'eadirection'`  option tells in which direction the size is affected.
 	Changing the height and width of a window can be avoided by setting
 	`'winfixheight'`  and `'winfixwidth'` , respectively.
 	If a window size is specified when creating a new window sizes are
 	currently not equalized (it's complicated, but may be implemented in
 	the future).

 	  item		default		Used for ~
 	  stl		' ' or `'^'` 	statusline of the current window
 	  stlnc		' ' or `'='` 	statusline of the non-current windows
 	  wbr		' '		window bar

 	  msgsep	' '		message separator `'display'` 
 	  eob		`'~'` 		empty lines at the end of a buffer
 	  lastline	`'@'` 		`'display'`  contains lastline/truncate
 
 	Any one that is omitted will fall back to the default.  For "stl" and
 	"stlnc" the space will be used when there is highlighting, `'^'`  or `'='` 
 	otherwise.
 
 	Note that "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown", "vertleft", "vertright" and
 	"verthoriz" are only used when `'laststatus'`  is 3, since only vertical
 	window separators are used otherwise.
 
 	If `'ambiwidth'`  is "double" then "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown",
 	"vert", "vertleft", "vertright", "verthoriz", "foldsep" and "fold"
 	default to single-byte alternatives.
 
 	Example: >
 	    :set fillchars=stl:^,stlnc:=,vert:│,fold:·,diff:-
 <	This is similar to the default, except that these characters will also
 	be used when there is highlighting.
 
 	For the "stl", "stlnc", "foldopen", "foldclose" and "foldsep" items
 	single-byte and multibyte characters are supported.  But double-width
 	characters are not supported.
 
 	The highlighting used for these items:
 	  item		highlight group ~
 	  stl		StatusLine		|hl-StatusLine|
 	  stlnc		StatusLineNC		|hl-StatusLineNC|

 	  vert		WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  vertleft	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  vertright	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  verthoriz	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  fold		Folded			|hl-Folded|
 	  diff		DiffDelete		|hl-DiffDelete|
 	  eob		EndOfBuffer		|hl-EndOfBuffer|
 	  lastline	NonText			|hl-NonText|

## fdc


```lua
vim.opt.foldcolumn
```

 `'foldcolumn'`  `'fdc'` 	string (default "0")
 			local to window
 	When and how to draw the foldcolumn. Valid values are:
 	    "auto":       resize to the minimum amount of folds to display.
 	    "auto:[1-9]": resize to accommodate multiple folds up to the
 			  selected level
             0:            to disable foldcolumn
 	    "[1-9]":      to display a fixed number of columns
 	See |folding|.

## fde


```lua
vim.opt.foldexpr
```

 `'foldexpr'`  `'fde'` 	string (default: "0")
 			local to window
 	The expression used for when `'foldmethod'`  is "expr".  It is evaluated
 	for each line to obtain its fold level.  See |fold-expr|.
 
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the `'diff'`  option is
 	on or the `'modelineexpr'`  option is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'foldexpr'`  |textlock|.

## fdi


```lua
vim.opt.foldignore
```

 `'foldignore'`  `'fdi'` 	string (default: "#")
 			local to window
 	Used only when `'foldmethod'`  is "indent".  Lines starting with
 	characters in `'foldignore'`  will get their fold level from surrounding
 	lines.  White space is skipped before checking for this character.
 	The default "#" works well for C programs.  See |fold-indent|.

## fdl


```lua
vim.opt.foldlevel
```

 `'foldlevel'`  `'fdl'` 	number (default: 0)
 			local to window
 	Sets the fold level: Folds with a higher level will be closed.
 	Setting this option to zero will close all folds.  Higher numbers will
 	close fewer folds.
 	This option is set by commands like |zm|, |zM| and |zR|.
 	See |fold-foldlevel|.

## fdls


```lua
vim.opt.foldlevelstart
```

 `'foldlevelstart'`  `'fdls'` 	number (default: -1)
 			global
 	Sets `'foldlevel'`  when starting to edit another buffer in a window.
 	Useful to always start editing with all folds closed (value zero),
 	some folds closed (one) or no folds closed (99).
 	This is done before reading any modeline, thus a setting in a modeline
 	overrules this option.  Starting to edit a file for |diff-mode| also
 	ignores this option and closes all folds.
 	It is also done before BufReadPre autocommands, to allow an autocmd to
 	overrule the `'foldlevel'`  value for specific files.
 	When the value is negative, it is not used.

## fdm


```lua
vim.opt.foldmethod
```

 `'foldmethod'`  `'fdm'` 	string (default: "manual")
 			local to window
 	The kind of folding used for the current window.  Possible values:
 	|fold-manual|	manual	    Folds are created manually.
 	|fold-indent|	indent	    Lines with equal indent form a fold.
 	|fold-expr|	expr	    `'foldexpr'`  gives the fold level of a line.
 	|fold-marker|	marker	    Markers are used to specify folds.
 	|fold-syntax|	syntax	    Syntax highlighting items specify folds.
 	|fold-diff|	diff	    Fold text that is not changed.

## fdn


```lua
vim.opt.foldnestmax
```

 `'foldnestmax'`  `'fdn'` 	number (default: 20)
 			local to window
 	Sets the maximum nesting of folds for the "indent" and "syntax"
 	methods.  This avoids that too many folds will be created.  Using more
 	than 20 doesn't work, because the internal limit is 20.

## fdo


```lua
vim.opt.foldopen
```

 `'foldopen'`  `'fdo'` 	string (default: "block,hor,mark,percent,quickfix,
 							     search,tag,undo")
 			global
 	Specifies for which type of commands folds will be opened, if the
 	command moves the cursor into a closed fold.  It is a comma-separated
 	list of items.
 	NOTE: When the command is part of a mapping this option is not used.
 	Add the |zv| command to the mapping to get the same effect.
 	(rationale: the mapping may want to control opening folds itself)
 
 		item		commands ~
 		all		any
 		block		"(", "{", "[[", "[{", etc.
 		hor		horizontal movements: "l", "w", "fx", etc.
 		insert		any command in Insert mode
 		jump		far jumps: "G", "gg", etc.
 		mark		jumping to a mark: "'m", CTRL-O, etc.
 		percent		"%"
 		quickfix	":cn", ":crew", ":make", etc.
 		search		search for a pattern: "/", "n", "*", "gd", etc.
 				(not for a search pattern in a ":" command)
 				Also for |[s| and |]s|.
 		tag		jumping to a tag: ":ta", CTRL-T, etc.
 		undo		undo or redo: "u" and CTRL-R
 	When a movement command is used for an operator (e.g., "dl" or "y%")
 	this option is not used.  This means the operator will include the
 	whole closed fold.
 	Note that vertical movements are not here, because it would make it
 	very difficult to move onto a closed fold.
 	In insert mode the folds containing the cursor will always be open
 	when text is inserted.
 	To close folds you can re-apply `'foldlevel'`  with the |zx| command or
 	set the `'foldclose'`  option to "all".

## fdt


```lua
vim.opt.foldtext
```

 `'foldtext'`  `'fdt'` 	string (default: "foldtext()")
 			local to window
 	An expression which is used to specify the text displayed for a closed
 	fold.  See |fold-foldtext|.
 
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'foldtext'`  |textlock|.

## fen


```lua
vim.opt.foldenable
```

 `'foldenable'`  `'fen'` 	boolean (default on)
 			local to window
 	When off, all folds are open.  This option can be used to quickly
 	switch between showing all text unfolded and viewing the text with
 	folds (including manually opened or closed folds).  It can be toggled
 	with the |zi| command.  The `'foldcolumn'`  will remain blank when
 	`'foldenable'`  is off.
 	This option is set by commands that create a new fold or close a fold.
 	See |folding|.

## fenc


```lua
vim.opt.fileencoding
```

 `'fileencoding'`  `'fenc'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	File-content encoding for the current buffer. Conversion is done with
 	iconv() or as specified with `'charconvert'` .
 
 	When `'fileencoding'`  is not UTF-8, conversion will be done when
 	writing the file.  For reading see below.
 	When `'fileencoding'`  is empty, the file will be saved with UTF-8
 	encoding (no conversion when reading or writing a file).
 
 	WARNING: Conversion to a non-Unicode encoding can cause loss of
 	information!
 
 	See |encoding-names| for the possible values.  Additionally, values may be
 	specified that can be handled by the converter, see
 	|mbyte-conversion|.
 
 	When reading a file `'fileencoding'`  will be set from `'fileencodings'` .
 	To read a file in a certain encoding it won't work by setting
 	`'fileencoding'` , use the |++enc| argument.  One exception: when
 	`'fileencodings'`  is empty the value of `'fileencoding'`  is used.
 	For a new file the global value of `'fileencoding'`  is used.
 
 	Prepending "8bit-" and "2byte-" has no meaning here, they are ignored.
 	When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
 	you can set it with uppercase values too.  `'_'`  characters are
 	replaced with `'-'` .  If a name is recognized from the list at
 	|encoding-names|, it is replaced by the standard name.  For example
 	"ISO8859-2" becomes "iso-8859-2".
 
 	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the `'modified'` 
 	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
 
 	Keep in mind that changing `'fenc'`  from a modeline happens
 	AFTER the text has been read, thus it applies to when the file will be
 	written.  If you do set `'fenc'`  in a modeline, you might want to set
 	`'nomodified'`  to avoid not being able to ":q".
 
 	This option cannot be changed when `'modifiable'`  is off.

## fencs


```lua
vim.opt.fileencodings
```

 `'fileencodings'`  `'fencs'` 	string (default: "ucs-bom,utf-8,default,latin1")
 			global
 	This is a list of character encodings considered when starting to edit
 	an existing file.  When a file is read, Vim tries to use the first
 	mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one
 	in the list is tried.  When an encoding is found that works,
 	`'fileencoding'`  is set to it.  If all fail, `'fileencoding'`  is set to
 	an empty string, which means that UTF-8 is used.
 		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use
 		the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
 		that can't be converted.
 	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
 	will work and the first entry of `'fileencodings'`  will be used (except
 	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
 	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
 	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
 		au BufReadPost * if search(`'\S'` , `'w'` ) == 0 |
 			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
 <	This sets `'fileencoding'`  to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
 	non-blank characters.
 	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of `'fileencodings'`  is
 	not used.
 	Note that `'fileencodings'`  is not used for a new file, the global value
 	of `'fileencoding'`  is used instead.  You can set it with: >
 		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
 <	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
 	an empty file.
 	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
 	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
 	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
 	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
 	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
 	accepted.
 	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
 	environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
 	encoding, such as Russian.
 	When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be
 	recognized as "utf-8".  You can use the |8g8| command to find the
 	illegal byte sequence.
 	WRONG VALUES:			WHAT'S WRONG:
 		latin1,utf-8		"latin1" will always be used
 		utf-8,ucs-bom,latin1	BOM won't be recognized in an utf-8
 					file
 		cp1250,latin1		"cp1250" will always be used
 	If `'fileencodings'`  is empty, `'fileencoding'`  is not modified.
 	See `'fileencoding'`  for the possible values.
 	Setting this option does not have an effect until the next time a file
 	is read.

## fex


```lua
vim.opt.formatexpr
```

 `'formatexpr'`  `'fex'` 	string (default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression which is evaluated to format a range of lines for the |gq|
 	operator or automatic formatting (see `'formatoptions'` ).  When this
 	option is empty `'formatprg'`  is used.
 
 	The |v:lnum|  variable holds the first line to be formatted.
 	The |v:count| variable holds the number of lines to be formatted.
 	The |v:char|  variable holds the character that is going to be
 		      inserted if the expression is being evaluated due to
 		      automatic formatting.  This can be empty.  Don't insert
 		      it yet!
 
 	Example: >
 		:set formatexpr=mylang#Format()
 <	This will invoke the mylang#Format() function in the
 	autoload/mylang.vim file in `'runtimepath'` . |autoload|
 
 	The expression is also evaluated when `'textwidth'`  is set and adding
 	text beyond that limit.  This happens under the same conditions as
 	when internal formatting is used.  Make sure the cursor is kept in the
 	same spot relative to the text then!  The |mode()| function will
 	return "i" or "R" in this situation.
 
 	When the expression evaluates to non-zero Vim will fall back to using
 	the internal format mechanism.
 
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set formatexpr=s:MyFormatExpr()
 		set formatexpr=<SID>SomeFormatExpr()
 <
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.  That stops the option from working,
 	since changing the buffer text is not allowed.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 	NOTE: This option is set to "" when `'compatible'`  is set.

## ff


```lua
vim.opt.fileformat
```

 `'fileformat'`  `'ff'` 	string (Windows default: "dos",
 				Unix default: "unix")
 			local to buffer
 	This gives the <EOL> of the current buffer, which is used for
 	reading/writing the buffer from/to a file:
 	    dos	    <CR><NL>
 	    unix    <NL>
 	    mac	    <CR>
 	When "dos" is used, CTRL-Z at the end of a file is ignored.
 	See |file-formats| and |file-read|.
 	For the character encoding of the file see `'fileencoding'` .
 	When `'binary'`  is set, the value of `'fileformat'`  is ignored, file I/O
 	works like it was set to "unix".
 	This option is set automatically when starting to edit a file and
 	`'fileformats'`  is not empty and `'binary'`  is off.
 	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the `'modified'` 
 	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
 	This option cannot be changed when `'modifiable'`  is off.

## ffs


```lua
vim.opt.fileformats
```

 `'fileformats'`  `'ffs'` 	string (default:
 				Win32: "dos,unix",
 				Unix: "unix,dos")
 			global
 	This gives the end-of-line (<EOL>) formats that will be tried when
 	starting to edit a new buffer and when reading a file into an existing
 	buffer:
 	- When empty, the format defined with `'fileformat'`  will be used
 	  always.  It is not set automatically.
 	- When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
 	  is opened.  `'fileformat'`  is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
 	  `'fileformats'`  name will be used when a file is read into an existing
 	  buffer, no matter what `'fileformat'`  for that buffer is set to.
 	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
 	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
 	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
 	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and `'fileformats'`  includes "dos",
 	     `'fileformat'`  is set to "dos".
 	  2. If a <NL> is found and `'fileformats'`  includes "unix", `'fileformat'` 
 	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
 	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
 	  3. If `'fileformat'`  has not yet been set, and if a <CR> is found, and
 	     if `'fileformats'`  includes "mac", `'fileformat'`  is set to "mac".
 	     This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
 	      "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
 	      "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
 	     Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
 	     the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
 	     the first few lines, "mac" is used.
 	  4. If `'fileformat'`  is still not set, the first name from
 	     `'fileformats'`  is used.
 	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
 	  this happens like `'fileformat'`  has been set appropriately for that
 	  file only, the option is not changed.
 	When `'binary'`  is set, the value of `'fileformats'`  is not used.
 
 	When Vim starts up with an empty buffer the first item is used.  You
 	can overrule this by setting `'fileformat'`  in your .vimrc.
 
 	For systems with a Dos-like <EOL> (<CR><NL>), when reading files that
 	are ":source"ed and for vimrc files, automatic <EOL> detection may be
 	done:
 	- When `'fileformats'`  is empty, there is no automatic detection.  Dos
 	  format will be used.
 	- When `'fileformats'`  is set to one or more names, automatic detection
 	  is done.  This is based on the first <NL> in the file: If there is a
 	  <CR> in front of it, Dos format is used, otherwise Unix format is
 	  used.
 	Also see |file-formats|.

## fic


```lua
vim.opt.fileignorecase
```

 `'fileignorecase'`  `'fic'` 	boolean	(default on for systems where case in file
 				 names is normally ignored)
 			global
 	When set case is ignored when using file names and directories.
 	See `'wildignorecase'`  for only ignoring case when doing completion.

## fileencoding


```lua
string
```

 `'fileencoding'`  `'fenc'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	File-content encoding for the current buffer. Conversion is done with
 	iconv() or as specified with `'charconvert'` .
 
 	When `'fileencoding'`  is not UTF-8, conversion will be done when
 	writing the file.  For reading see below.
 	When `'fileencoding'`  is empty, the file will be saved with UTF-8
 	encoding (no conversion when reading or writing a file).
 
 	WARNING: Conversion to a non-Unicode encoding can cause loss of
 	information!
 
 	See |encoding-names| for the possible values.  Additionally, values may be
 	specified that can be handled by the converter, see
 	|mbyte-conversion|.
 
 	When reading a file `'fileencoding'`  will be set from `'fileencodings'` .
 	To read a file in a certain encoding it won't work by setting
 	`'fileencoding'` , use the |++enc| argument.  One exception: when
 	`'fileencodings'`  is empty the value of `'fileencoding'`  is used.
 	For a new file the global value of `'fileencoding'`  is used.
 
 	Prepending "8bit-" and "2byte-" has no meaning here, they are ignored.
 	When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
 	you can set it with uppercase values too.  `'_'`  characters are
 	replaced with `'-'` .  If a name is recognized from the list at
 	|encoding-names|, it is replaced by the standard name.  For example
 	"ISO8859-2" becomes "iso-8859-2".
 
 	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the `'modified'` 
 	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
 
 	Keep in mind that changing `'fenc'`  from a modeline happens
 	AFTER the text has been read, thus it applies to when the file will be
 	written.  If you do set `'fenc'`  in a modeline, you might want to set
 	`'nomodified'`  to avoid not being able to ":q".
 
 	This option cannot be changed when `'modifiable'`  is off.

## filetype


```lua
string
```

 `'filetype'`  `'ft'` 		string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	When this option is set, the FileType autocommand event is triggered.
 	All autocommands that match with the value of this option will be
 	executed.  Thus the value of `'filetype'`  is used in place of the file
 	name.
 	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current file type.
 	This option is normally set when the file type is detected.  To enable
 	this use the ":filetype on" command. |:filetype|
 	Setting this option to a different value is most useful in a modeline,
 	for a file for which the file type is not automatically recognized.
 	Example, for in an IDL file: >
 		/* vim: set filetype=idl : */
 <	|FileType| |filetypes|
 	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
 	names.  Example: >
 		/* vim: set filetype=c.doxygen : */
 <	This will use the "c" filetype first, then the "doxygen" filetype.
 	This works both for filetype plugins and for syntax files.  More than
 	one dot may appear.
 	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the `'s'`  or
 	`'S'`  flag in `'cpoptions'` .
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

## fillchars


```lua
string
```

 `'fillchars'`  `'fcs'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Characters to fill the statuslines, vertical separators and special
 	lines in the window.
 	It is a comma-separated list of items.  Each item has a name, a colon
 	and the value of that item:
 
 	  item		default		Used for ~
 	  stl		' ' or `'^'` 	statusline of the current window
 	  stlnc		' ' or `'='` 	statusline of the non-current windows
 	  wbr		' '		window bar
 	  horiz		`'─'`  or `'-'` 	horizontal separators |:split|
 	  horizup	`'┴'`  or `'-'` 	upwards facing horizontal separator
 	  horizdown	`'┬'`  or `'-'` 	downwards facing horizontal separator
 	  vert		`'│'`  or `'|'` 	vertical separators |:vsplit|
 	  vertleft	`'┤'`  or `'|'` 	left facing vertical separator
 	  vertright	`'├'`  or `'|'` 	right facing vertical separator
 	  verthoriz	`'┼'`  or `'+'` 	overlapping vertical and horizontal
 					separator
 	  fold		`'·'`  or `'-'` 	filling `'foldtext'` 
 	  foldopen	`'-'` 		mark the beginning of a fold
 	  foldclose	`'+'` 		show a closed fold
 	  foldsep	`'│'`  or `'|'`       open fold middle marker
 	  diff		`'-'` 		deleted lines of the `'diff'`  option
 	  msgsep	' '		message separator `'display'` 
 	  eob		`'~'` 		empty lines at the end of a buffer
 	  lastline	`'@'` 		`'display'`  contains lastline/truncate
 
 	Any one that is omitted will fall back to the default.  For "stl" and
 	"stlnc" the space will be used when there is highlighting, `'^'`  or `'='` 
 	otherwise.
 
 	Note that "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown", "vertleft", "vertright" and
 	"verthoriz" are only used when `'laststatus'`  is 3, since only vertical
 	window separators are used otherwise.
 
 	If `'ambiwidth'`  is "double" then "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown",
 	"vert", "vertleft", "vertright", "verthoriz", "foldsep" and "fold"
 	default to single-byte alternatives.
 
 	Example: >
 	    :set fillchars=stl:^,stlnc:=,vert:│,fold:·,diff:-
 <	This is similar to the default, except that these characters will also
 	be used when there is highlighting.
 
 	For the "stl", "stlnc", "foldopen", "foldclose" and "foldsep" items
 	single-byte and multibyte characters are supported.  But double-width
 	characters are not supported.
 
 	The highlighting used for these items:
 	  item		highlight group ~
 	  stl		StatusLine		|hl-StatusLine|
 	  stlnc		StatusLineNC		|hl-StatusLineNC|
 	  wbr		WinBar			|hl-WinBar| or |hl-WinBarNC|
 	  horiz		WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|

## fixendofline


```lua
boolean
```

 `'fixendofline'`  `'fixeol'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	When writing a file and this option is on, <EOL> at the end of file
 	will be restored if missing.  Turn this option off if you want to
 	preserve the situation from the original file.
 	When the `'binary'`  option is set the value of this option doesn't
 	matter.
 	See the `'endofline'`  option.
 	See |eol-and-eof| for example settings.

## fixeol


```lua
vim.opt.fixendofline
```

 `'fixendofline'`  `'fixeol'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	When writing a file and this option is on, <EOL> at the end of file
 	will be restored if missing.  Turn this option off if you want to
 	preserve the situation from the original file.
 	When the `'binary'`  option is set the value of this option doesn't
 	matter.
 	See the `'endofline'`  option.
 	See |eol-and-eof| for example settings.

## flp


```lua
vim.opt.formatlistpat
```

 `'formatlistpat'`  `'flp'` 	string (default: "^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*")
 			local to buffer
 	A pattern that is used to recognize a list header.  This is used for
 	the "n" flag in `'formatoptions'` .
 	The pattern must match exactly the text that will be the indent for
 	the line below it.  You can use |/\ze| to mark the end of the match
 	while still checking more characters.  There must be a character
 	following the pattern, when it matches the whole line it is handled
 	like there is no match.
 	The default recognizes a number, followed by an optional punctuation
 	character and white space.

## fml


```lua
vim.opt.foldminlines
```

 `'foldminlines'`  `'fml'` 	number (default: 1)
 			local to window
 	Sets the number of screen lines above which a fold can be displayed
 	closed.  Also for manually closed folds.  With the default value of
 	one a fold can only be closed if it takes up two or more screen lines.
 	Set to zero to be able to close folds of just one screen line.
 	Note that this only has an effect on what is displayed.  After using
 	"zc" to close a fold, which is displayed open because it's smaller
 	than `'foldminlines'` , a following "zc" may close a containing fold.

## fmr


```lua
vim.opt.foldmarker
```

 `'foldmarker'`  `'fmr'` 	string (default: "{{{,}}}")
 			local to window
 	The start and end marker used when `'foldmethod'`  is "marker".  There
 	must be one comma, which separates the start and end marker.  The
 	marker is a literal string (a regular expression would be too slow).
 	See |fold-marker|.

## fo


```lua
vim.opt.formatoptions
```

 `'formatoptions'`  `'fo'` 	string (default: "tcqj")
 			local to buffer
 	This is a sequence of letters which describes how automatic
 	formatting is to be done.  See |fo-table|.  Commas can be inserted for
 	readability.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

## foldclose


```lua
string
```

 `'foldclose'`  `'fcl'` 	string (default "")
 			global
 	When set to "all", a fold is closed when the cursor isn't in it and
 	its level is higher than `'foldlevel'` .  Useful if you want folds to
 	automatically close when moving out of them.

## foldcolumn


```lua
string
```

 `'foldcolumn'`  `'fdc'` 	string (default "0")
 			local to window
 	When and how to draw the foldcolumn. Valid values are:
 	    "auto":       resize to the minimum amount of folds to display.
 	    "auto:[1-9]": resize to accommodate multiple folds up to the
 			  selected level
             0:            to disable foldcolumn
 	    "[1-9]":      to display a fixed number of columns
 	See |folding|.

## foldenable


```lua
boolean
```

 `'foldenable'`  `'fen'` 	boolean (default on)
 			local to window
 	When off, all folds are open.  This option can be used to quickly
 	switch between showing all text unfolded and viewing the text with
 	folds (including manually opened or closed folds).  It can be toggled
 	with the |zi| command.  The `'foldcolumn'`  will remain blank when
 	`'foldenable'`  is off.
 	This option is set by commands that create a new fold or close a fold.
 	See |folding|.

## foldexpr


```lua
string
```

 `'foldexpr'`  `'fde'` 	string (default: "0")
 			local to window
 	The expression used for when `'foldmethod'`  is "expr".  It is evaluated
 	for each line to obtain its fold level.  See |fold-expr|.
 
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the `'diff'`  option is
 	on or the `'modelineexpr'`  option is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'foldexpr'`  |textlock|.

## foldignore


```lua
string
```

 `'foldignore'`  `'fdi'` 	string (default: "#")
 			local to window
 	Used only when `'foldmethod'`  is "indent".  Lines starting with
 	characters in `'foldignore'`  will get their fold level from surrounding
 	lines.  White space is skipped before checking for this character.
 	The default "#" works well for C programs.  See |fold-indent|.

## foldlevel


```lua
integer
```

 `'foldlevel'`  `'fdl'` 	number (default: 0)
 			local to window
 	Sets the fold level: Folds with a higher level will be closed.
 	Setting this option to zero will close all folds.  Higher numbers will
 	close fewer folds.
 	This option is set by commands like |zm|, |zM| and |zR|.
 	See |fold-foldlevel|.

## foldlevelstart


```lua
integer
```

 `'foldlevelstart'`  `'fdls'` 	number (default: -1)
 			global
 	Sets `'foldlevel'`  when starting to edit another buffer in a window.
 	Useful to always start editing with all folds closed (value zero),
 	some folds closed (one) or no folds closed (99).
 	This is done before reading any modeline, thus a setting in a modeline
 	overrules this option.  Starting to edit a file for |diff-mode| also
 	ignores this option and closes all folds.
 	It is also done before BufReadPre autocommands, to allow an autocmd to
 	overrule the `'foldlevel'`  value for specific files.
 	When the value is negative, it is not used.

## foldmarker


```lua
string
```

 `'foldmarker'`  `'fmr'` 	string (default: "{{{,}}}")
 			local to window
 	The start and end marker used when `'foldmethod'`  is "marker".  There
 	must be one comma, which separates the start and end marker.  The
 	marker is a literal string (a regular expression would be too slow).
 	See |fold-marker|.

## foldmethod


```lua
string
```

 `'foldmethod'`  `'fdm'` 	string (default: "manual")
 			local to window
 	The kind of folding used for the current window.  Possible values:
 	|fold-manual|	manual	    Folds are created manually.
 	|fold-indent|	indent	    Lines with equal indent form a fold.
 	|fold-expr|	expr	    `'foldexpr'`  gives the fold level of a line.
 	|fold-marker|	marker	    Markers are used to specify folds.
 	|fold-syntax|	syntax	    Syntax highlighting items specify folds.
 	|fold-diff|	diff	    Fold text that is not changed.

## foldminlines


```lua
integer
```

 `'foldminlines'`  `'fml'` 	number (default: 1)
 			local to window
 	Sets the number of screen lines above which a fold can be displayed
 	closed.  Also for manually closed folds.  With the default value of
 	one a fold can only be closed if it takes up two or more screen lines.
 	Set to zero to be able to close folds of just one screen line.
 	Note that this only has an effect on what is displayed.  After using
 	"zc" to close a fold, which is displayed open because it's smaller
 	than `'foldminlines'` , a following "zc" may close a containing fold.

## foldnestmax


```lua
integer
```

 `'foldnestmax'`  `'fdn'` 	number (default: 20)
 			local to window
 	Sets the maximum nesting of folds for the "indent" and "syntax"
 	methods.  This avoids that too many folds will be created.  Using more
 	than 20 doesn't work, because the internal limit is 20.

## foldopen


```lua
string
```

 `'foldopen'`  `'fdo'` 	string (default: "block,hor,mark,percent,quickfix,
 							     search,tag,undo")
 			global
 	Specifies for which type of commands folds will be opened, if the
 	command moves the cursor into a closed fold.  It is a comma-separated
 	list of items.
 	NOTE: When the command is part of a mapping this option is not used.
 	Add the |zv| command to the mapping to get the same effect.
 	(rationale: the mapping may want to control opening folds itself)
 
 		item		commands ~
 		all		any
 		block		"(", "{", "[[", "[{", etc.
 		hor		horizontal movements: "l", "w", "fx", etc.
 		insert		any command in Insert mode
 		jump		far jumps: "G", "gg", etc.
 		mark		jumping to a mark: "'m", CTRL-O, etc.
 		percent		"%"
 		quickfix	":cn", ":crew", ":make", etc.
 		search		search for a pattern: "/", "n", "*", "gd", etc.
 				(not for a search pattern in a ":" command)
 				Also for |[s| and |]s|.
 		tag		jumping to a tag: ":ta", CTRL-T, etc.
 		undo		undo or redo: "u" and CTRL-R
 	When a movement command is used for an operator (e.g., "dl" or "y%")
 	this option is not used.  This means the operator will include the
 	whole closed fold.
 	Note that vertical movements are not here, because it would make it
 	very difficult to move onto a closed fold.
 	In insert mode the folds containing the cursor will always be open
 	when text is inserted.
 	To close folds you can re-apply `'foldlevel'`  with the |zx| command or
 	set the `'foldclose'`  option to "all".

## foldtext


```lua
string
```

 `'foldtext'`  `'fdt'` 	string (default: "foldtext()")
 			local to window
 	An expression which is used to specify the text displayed for a closed
 	fold.  See |fold-foldtext|.
 
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'foldtext'`  |textlock|.

## formatexpr


```lua
string
```

 `'formatexpr'`  `'fex'` 	string (default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression which is evaluated to format a range of lines for the |gq|
 	operator or automatic formatting (see `'formatoptions'` ).  When this
 	option is empty `'formatprg'`  is used.
 
 	The |v:lnum|  variable holds the first line to be formatted.
 	The |v:count| variable holds the number of lines to be formatted.
 	The |v:char|  variable holds the character that is going to be
 		      inserted if the expression is being evaluated due to
 		      automatic formatting.  This can be empty.  Don't insert
 		      it yet!
 
 	Example: >
 		:set formatexpr=mylang#Format()
 <	This will invoke the mylang#Format() function in the
 	autoload/mylang.vim file in `'runtimepath'` . |autoload|
 
 	The expression is also evaluated when `'textwidth'`  is set and adding
 	text beyond that limit.  This happens under the same conditions as
 	when internal formatting is used.  Make sure the cursor is kept in the
 	same spot relative to the text then!  The |mode()| function will
 	return "i" or "R" in this situation.
 
 	When the expression evaluates to non-zero Vim will fall back to using
 	the internal format mechanism.
 
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set formatexpr=s:MyFormatExpr()
 		set formatexpr=<SID>SomeFormatExpr()
 <
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.  That stops the option from working,
 	since changing the buffer text is not allowed.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 	NOTE: This option is set to "" when `'compatible'`  is set.

## formatlistpat


```lua
string
```

 `'formatlistpat'`  `'flp'` 	string (default: "^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*")
 			local to buffer
 	A pattern that is used to recognize a list header.  This is used for
 	the "n" flag in `'formatoptions'` .
 	The pattern must match exactly the text that will be the indent for
 	the line below it.  You can use |/\ze| to mark the end of the match
 	while still checking more characters.  There must be a character
 	following the pattern, when it matches the whole line it is handled
 	like there is no match.
 	The default recognizes a number, followed by an optional punctuation
 	character and white space.

## formatoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'formatoptions'`  `'fo'` 	string (default: "tcqj")
 			local to buffer
 	This is a sequence of letters which describes how automatic
 	formatting is to be done.  See |fo-table|.  Commas can be inserted for
 	readability.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

## formatprg


```lua
string
```

 `'formatprg'`  `'fp'` 	string (default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	The name of an external program that will be used to format the lines
 	selected with the |gq| operator.  The program must take the input on
 	stdin and produce the output on stdout.  The Unix program "fmt" is
 	such a program.
 	If the `'formatexpr'`  option is not empty it will be used instead.
 	Otherwise, if `'formatprg'`  option is an empty string, the internal
 	format function will be used |C-indenting|.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
 	about including spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## fp


```lua
vim.opt.formatprg
```

 `'formatprg'`  `'fp'` 	string (default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	The name of an external program that will be used to format the lines
 	selected with the |gq| operator.  The program must take the input on
 	stdin and produce the output on stdout.  The Unix program "fmt" is
 	such a program.
 	If the `'formatexpr'`  option is not empty it will be used instead.
 	Otherwise, if `'formatprg'`  option is an empty string, the internal
 	format function will be used |C-indenting|.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
 	about including spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## fs


```lua
vim.opt.fsync
```

 `'fsync'`  `'fs'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, the OS function fsync() will be called after saving a file
 	(|:write|, |writefile()|, …), |swap-file| and |shada-file|. This
 	flushes the file to disk, ensuring that it is safely written.
 	Slow on some systems: writing buffers, quitting Nvim, and other
 	operations may sometimes take a few seconds.
 
 	Files are ALWAYS flushed (`'fsync'`  is ignored) when:
 	- |CursorHold| event is triggered
 	- |:preserve| is called
 	- system signals low battery life
 	- Nvim exits abnormally
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## fsync


```lua
boolean
```

 `'fsync'`  `'fs'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, the OS function fsync() will be called after saving a file
 	(|:write|, |writefile()|, …), |swap-file| and |shada-file|. This
 	flushes the file to disk, ensuring that it is safely written.
 	Slow on some systems: writing buffers, quitting Nvim, and other
 	operations may sometimes take a few seconds.
 
 	Files are ALWAYS flushed (`'fsync'`  is ignored) when:
 	- |CursorHold| event is triggered
 	- |:preserve| is called
 	- system signals low battery life
 	- Nvim exits abnormally
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## ft


```lua
vim.opt.filetype
```

 `'filetype'`  `'ft'` 		string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	When this option is set, the FileType autocommand event is triggered.
 	All autocommands that match with the value of this option will be
 	executed.  Thus the value of `'filetype'`  is used in place of the file
 	name.
 	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current file type.
 	This option is normally set when the file type is detected.  To enable
 	this use the ":filetype on" command. |:filetype|
 	Setting this option to a different value is most useful in a modeline,
 	for a file for which the file type is not automatically recognized.
 	Example, for in an IDL file: >
 		/* vim: set filetype=idl : */
 <	|FileType| |filetypes|
 	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
 	names.  Example: >
 		/* vim: set filetype=c.doxygen : */
 <	This will use the "c" filetype first, then the "doxygen" filetype.
 	This works both for filetype plugins and for syntax files.  More than
 	one dot may appear.
 	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the `'s'`  or
 	`'S'`  flag in `'cpoptions'` .
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

## gcr


```lua
vim.opt.guicursor
```

 `'guicursor'`  `'gcr'` 	string	(default "n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr-o:hor20")
 			global
 	Configures the cursor style for each mode. Works in the GUI and many
 	terminals.  See |tui-cursor-shape|.
 
 	To disable cursor-styling, reset the option: >
 		:set guicursor=
 
 <	To enable mode shapes, "Cursor" highlight, and blinking: >
 		:set guicursor=n-v-c:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr:hor20,o:hor50
 		  \,a:blinkwait700-blinkoff400-blinkon250-Cursor/lCursor
 		  \,sm:block-blinkwait175-blinkoff150-blinkon175
 
 <	The option is a comma-separated list of parts.  Each part consists of a
 	mode-list and an argument-list:
 		mode-list:argument-list,mode-list:argument-list,..
 	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes:
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		ve	Visual mode with `'selection'`  "exclusive" (same as `'v'` ,
 			if not specified)
 		o	Operator-pending mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		r	Replace mode
 		c	Command-line Normal (append) mode
 		ci	Command-line Insert mode
 		cr	Command-line Replace mode
 		sm	showmatch in Insert mode
 		a	all modes
 	The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
 		hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
 		ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
 		block	block cursor, fills the whole character
 			- Only one of the above three should be present.
 			- Default is "block" for each mode.
 		blinkwait{N}
 		blinkon{N}
 		blinkoff{N}
 			blink times for cursor: blinkwait is the delay before
 			the cursor starts blinking, blinkon is the time that
 			the cursor is shown and blinkoff is the time that the
 			cursor is not shown.  Times are in msec.  When one of
 			the numbers is zero, there is no blinking. E.g.: >
 				:set guicursor=n:blinkon0
 <			- Default is "blinkon0" for each mode.
 		{group-name}
 			Highlight group that decides the color and font of the
 			cursor.
 			In the |TUI|:
 			- |inverse|/reverse and no group-name are interpreted
 			  as "host-terminal default cursor colors" which
 			  typically means "inverted bg and fg colors".
 			- |ctermfg| and |guifg| are ignored.
 		{group-name}/{group-name}
 			Two highlight group names, the first is used when
 			no language mappings are used, the other when they
 			are. |language-mapping|
 
 	Examples of parts:
 	   n-c-v:block-nCursor	In Normal, Command-line and Visual mode, use a
 				block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
 				highlight group
 	   n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25-Cursor,r-cr-o:hor20
 				In Normal et al. modes, use a block cursor
 				with the default colors defined by the host
 				terminal.  In Insert-likes modes, use
 				a vertical bar cursor with colors from
 				"Cursor" highlight group.  In Replace-likes
 				modes, use a underline cursor with
 				default colors.
 	   i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
 				In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
 				30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
 				"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
 				faster.
 
 	The `'a'`  mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
 	all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
 	to do a common setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
 	blinking: "a:blinkon0"
 
 	Examples of cursor highlighting: >
 	    :highlight Cursor gui=reverse guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
 	    :highlight Cursor gui=NONE guifg=bg guibg=fg
 <

## gd


```lua
vim.opt.gdefault
```

 `'gdefault'`  `'gd'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, the ":substitute" flag `'g'`  is default on.  This means that
 	all matches in a line are substituted instead of one.  When a `'g'`  flag
 	is given to a ":substitute" command, this will toggle the substitution
 	of all or one match.  See |complex-change|.
 
 		command		`'gdefault'`  on	`'gdefault'`  off	~
 		:s///		  subst. all	  subst. one
 		:s///g		  subst. one	  subst. all
 		:s///gg		  subst. all	  subst. one
 
 	DEPRECATED: Setting this option may break plugins that are not aware
 	of this option.  Also, many users get confused that adding the /g flag
 	has the opposite effect of that it normally does.

## gdefault


```lua
boolean
```

 `'gdefault'`  `'gd'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, the ":substitute" flag `'g'`  is default on.  This means that
 	all matches in a line are substituted instead of one.  When a `'g'`  flag
 	is given to a ":substitute" command, this will toggle the substitution
 	of all or one match.  See |complex-change|.
 
 		command		`'gdefault'`  on	`'gdefault'`  off	~
 		:s///		  subst. all	  subst. one
 		:s///g		  subst. one	  subst. all

 	DEPRECATED: Setting this option may break plugins that are not aware
 	of this option.  Also, many users get confused that adding the /g flag
 	has the opposite effect of that it normally does.

## gfm


```lua
vim.opt.grepformat
```

 `'grepformat'`  `'gfm'` 	string	(default "%f:%l:%m,%f:%l%m,%f  %l%m")
 			global
 	Format to recognize for the ":grep" command output.
 	This is a scanf-like string that uses the same format as the
 	`'errorformat'`  option: see |errorformat|.

## gfn


```lua
vim.opt.guifont
```

 `'guifont'`  `'gfn'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	This is a list of fonts which will be used for the GUI version of Vim.
 	In its simplest form the value is just one font name.  When
 	the font cannot be found you will get an error message.  To try other
 	font names a list can be specified, font names separated with commas.
 	The first valid font is used.
 
 	Spaces after a comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name
 	precede it with a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra
 	backslash before a space and a backslash.  See also
 	|option-backslash|.  For example: >
 	    :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
 <	will make Vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails it
 	will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.
 
 	If none of the fonts can be loaded, Vim will keep the current setting.
 	If an empty font list is given, Vim will try using other resource
 	settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
 	will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
 	the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
 	will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.
 
 	For Win32 and Mac OS: >
 	    :set guifont=*
 <	will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.
 
 	The font name depends on the GUI used.
 
 	For Mac OSX you can use something like this: >
 	    :set guifont=Monaco:h10
 <
 	Note that the fonts must be mono-spaced (all characters have the same
 	width).
 
 	To preview a font on X11, you might be able to use the "xfontsel"
 	program.  The "xlsfonts" program gives a list of all available fonts.
 
 	For the Win32 GUI
 	- takes these options in the font name:
 		hXX - height is XX (points, can be floating-point)
 		wXX - width is XX (points, can be floating-point)
 		b   - bold
 		i   - italic
 		u   - underline
 		s   - strikeout
 		cXX - character set XX.  Valid charsets are: ANSI, ARABIC,
 		      BALTIC, CHINESEBIG5, DEFAULT, EASTEUROPE, GB2312, GREEK,
 		      HANGEUL, HEBREW, JOHAB, MAC, OEM, RUSSIAN, SHIFTJIS,
 		      SYMBOL, THAI, TURKISH, VIETNAMESE ANSI and BALTIC.
 		      Normally you would use "cDEFAULT".
 
 	  Use a `':'`  to separate the options.
 	- A `'_'`  can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
 	  backslashes to escape the spaces.

## gfw


```lua
vim.opt.guifontwide
```

 `'guifontwide'`  `'gfw'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	Comma-separated list of fonts to be used for double-width characters.
 	The first font that can be loaded is used.
 	Note: The size of these fonts must be exactly twice as wide as the one
 	specified with `'guifont'`  and the same height.
 
 	When `'guifont'`  has a valid font and `'guifontwide'`  is empty Vim will
 	attempt to set `'guifontwide'`  to a matching double-width font.

## go


```lua
vim.opt.guioptions
```

 `'guioptions'`  `'go'` 	string	(default "egmrLT"   (MS-Windows))
 			global
 	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim.  It is a
 	sequence of letters which describes what components and options of the
 	GUI should be used.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
 
 	Valid letters are as follows:
 
 	  `'a'` 	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
 		or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
 		the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
 		Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
 		applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
 		ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
 		application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
 		is automatically yanked into the "* selection register.
 		Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
 		applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
 		    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
 		windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
 		by a yank or delete operation for the "* register.
 		The same applies to the modeless selection.
 
 	  `'P'` 	Like autoselect but using the "+ register instead of the "*
 		register.
 
 	  `'A'` 	Autoselect for the modeless selection.  Like `'a'` , but only
 		applies to the modeless selection.
 
 		    `'guioptions'`    autoselect Visual  autoselect modeless ~
 			 ""		 -			 -
 			 "a"		yes			yes
 			 "A"		 -			yes
 			 "aA"		yes			yes
 
 
 	  `'c'` 	Use console dialogs instead of popup dialogs for simple
 		choices.
 
 	  `'d'` 	Use dark theme variant if available.
 
 	  `'e'` 	Add tab pages when indicated with `'showtabline'` .
 		`'guitablabel'`  can be used to change the text in the labels.
 		When `'e'`  is missing a non-GUI tab pages line may be used.
 		The GUI tabs are only supported on some systems, currently
 		Mac OS/X and MS-Windows.
 
 	  `'i'` 	Use a Vim icon.
 
 	  `'m'` 	Menu bar is present.
 
 	  `'M'` 	The system menu "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim" is not sourced.  Note
 		that this flag must be added in the vimrc file, before
 		switching on syntax or filetype recognition (when the |gvimrc|
 		file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded; the
 		`:syntax on` and `:filetype on` commands load the menu too).
 
 	  `'g'` 	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
 		`'g'`  is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.
 
 	  `'T'` 	Include Toolbar.  Currently only in Win32 GUI.
 
 	  `'r'` 	Right-hand scrollbar is always present.
 
 	  `'R'` 	Right-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
 		split window.
 
 	  `'l'` 	Left-hand scrollbar is always present.
 
 	  `'L'` 	Left-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
 		split window.
 
 	  `'b'` 	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present.  Its size depends on
 		the longest visible line, or on the cursor line if the `'h'` 
 		flag is included. |gui-horiz-scroll|
 
 	  `'h'` 	Limit horizontal scrollbar size to the length of the cursor
 		line.  Reduces computations. |gui-horiz-scroll|
 
 	And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
 	you really want to :-).  See |gui-scrollbars| for more information.
 
 
 	  `'v'` 	Use a vertical button layout for dialogs.  When not included,
 		a horizontal layout is preferred, but when it doesn't fit a
 		vertical layout is used anyway.  Not supported in GTK 3.
 
 	  `'p'` 	Use Pointer callbacks for X11 GUI.  This is required for some
 		window managers.  If the cursor is not blinking or hollow at
 		the right moment, try adding this flag.  This must be done
 		before starting the GUI.  Set it in your |gvimrc|.  Adding or
 		removing it after the GUI has started has no effect.
 
 	  `'k'` 	Keep the GUI window size when adding/removing a scrollbar, or
 		toolbar, tabline, etc.  Instead, the behavior is similar to
 		when the window is maximized and will adjust `'lines'`  and
 		`'columns'`  to fit to the window.  Without the `'k'`  flag Vim will
 		try to keep `'lines'`  and `'columns'`  the same when adding and
 		removing GUI components.

## gp


```lua
vim.opt.grepprg
```

 `'grepprg'`  `'gp'` 		string	(default "grep -n ",
 				 Unix: "grep -n $* /dev/null")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Program to use for the |:grep| command.  This option may contain `'%'` 
 	and `'#'`  characters, which are expanded like when used in a command-
 	line.  The placeholder "$*" is allowed to specify where the arguments
 	will be included.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See
 	|option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	When your "grep" accepts the "-H" argument, use this to make ":grep"
 	also work well with a single file: >
 		:set grepprg=grep\ -nH
 <	Special value: When `'grepprg'`  is set to "internal" the |:grep| command
 	works like |:vimgrep|, |:lgrep| like |:lvimgrep|, |:grepadd| like
 	|:vimgrepadd| and |:lgrepadd| like |:lvimgrepadd|.
 	See also the section |:make_makeprg|, since most of the comments there
 	apply equally to `'grepprg'` .
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## grepformat


```lua
string
```

 `'grepformat'`  `'gfm'` 	string	(default "%f:%l:%m,%f:%l%m,%f  %l%m")
 			global
 	Format to recognize for the ":grep" command output.
 	This is a scanf-like string that uses the same format as the
 	`'errorformat'`  option: see |errorformat|.

## grepprg


```lua
string
```

 `'grepprg'`  `'gp'` 		string	(default "grep -n ",
 				 Unix: "grep -n $* /dev/null")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Program to use for the |:grep| command.  This option may contain `'%'` 
 	and `'#'`  characters, which are expanded like when used in a command-
 	line.  The placeholder "$*" is allowed to specify where the arguments
 	will be included.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See
 	|option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	When your "grep" accepts the "-H" argument, use this to make ":grep"
 	also work well with a single file: >
 		:set grepprg=grep\ -nH
 <	Special value: When `'grepprg'`  is set to "internal" the |:grep| command
 	works like |:vimgrep|, |:lgrep| like |:lvimgrep|, |:grepadd| like
 	|:vimgrepadd| and |:lgrepadd| like |:lvimgrepadd|.
 	See also the section |:make_makeprg|, since most of the comments there
 	apply equally to `'grepprg'` .
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## gtl


```lua
vim.opt.guitablabel
```

 `'guitablabel'`  `'gtl'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty describes the text to use in a label of the GUI tab
 	pages line.  When empty and when the result is empty Vim will use a
 	default label.  See |setting-guitablabel| for more info.
 
 	The format of this option is like that of `'statusline'` .
 	`'guitabtooltip'`  is used for the tooltip, see below.
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	Only used when the GUI tab pages line is displayed.  `'e'`  must be
 	present in `'guioptions'` .  For the non-GUI tab pages line `'tabline'`  is
 	used.

## gtt


```lua
vim.opt.guitabtooltip
```

 `'guitabtooltip'`  `'gtt'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty describes the text to use in a tooltip for the GUI tab
 	pages line.  When empty Vim will use a default tooltip.
 	This option is otherwise just like `'guitablabel'`  above.
 	You can include a line break.  Simplest method is to use |:let|: >
 		:let &guitabtooltip = "line one\nline two"
 <

## guicursor


```lua
string
```

 `'guicursor'`  `'gcr'` 	string	(default "n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr-o:hor20")
 			global
 	Configures the cursor style for each mode. Works in the GUI and many
 	terminals.  See |tui-cursor-shape|.
 
 	To disable cursor-styling, reset the option: >
 		:set guicursor=
 
 <	To enable mode shapes, "Cursor" highlight, and blinking: >
 		:set guicursor=n-v-c:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr:hor20,o:hor50
 		  \,a:blinkwait700-blinkoff400-blinkon250-Cursor/lCursor
 		  \,sm:block-blinkwait175-blinkoff150-blinkon175
 
 <	The option is a comma-separated list of parts.  Each part consists of a
 	mode-list and an argument-list:
 		mode-list:argument-list,mode-list:argument-list,..
 	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes:
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		ve	Visual mode with `'selection'`  "exclusive" (same as `'v'` ,
 			if not specified)
 		o	Operator-pending mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		r	Replace mode
 		c	Command-line Normal (append) mode
 		ci	Command-line Insert mode
 		cr	Command-line Replace mode
 		sm	showmatch in Insert mode
 		a	all modes
 	The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
 		hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
 		ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
 		block	block cursor, fills the whole character
 			- Only one of the above three should be present.
 			- Default is "block" for each mode.
 		blinkwait{N}
 		blinkon{N}
 		blinkoff{N}
 			blink times for cursor: blinkwait is the delay before
 			the cursor starts blinking, blinkon is the time that
 			the cursor is shown and blinkoff is the time that the
 			cursor is not shown.  Times are in msec.  When one of
 			the numbers is zero, there is no blinking. E.g.: >
 				:set guicursor=n:blinkon0
 <			- Default is "blinkon0" for each mode.
 		{group-name}
 			Highlight group that decides the color and font of the
 			cursor.
 			In the |TUI|:
 			- |inverse|/reverse and no group-name are interpreted
 			  as "host-terminal default cursor colors" which
 			  typically means "inverted bg and fg colors".
 			- |ctermfg| and |guifg| are ignored.
 		{group-name}/{group-name}
 			Two highlight group names, the first is used when
 			no language mappings are used, the other when they
 			are. |language-mapping|
 
 	Examples of parts:
 	   n-c-v:block-nCursor	In Normal, Command-line and Visual mode, use a
 				block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
 				highlight group
 	   n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25-Cursor,r-cr-o:hor20
 				In Normal et al. modes, use a block cursor
 				with the default colors defined by the host
 				terminal.  In Insert-likes modes, use
 				a vertical bar cursor with colors from
 				"Cursor" highlight group.  In Replace-likes
 				modes, use a underline cursor with
 				default colors.
 	   i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
 				In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
 				30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
 				"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
 				faster.
 
 	The `'a'`  mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
 	all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
 	to do a common setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
 	blinking: "a:blinkon0"
 
 	Examples of cursor highlighting: >
 	    :highlight Cursor gui=reverse guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
 	    :highlight Cursor gui=NONE guifg=bg guibg=fg
 <

## guifont


```lua
string
```

 `'guifont'`  `'gfn'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	This is a list of fonts which will be used for the GUI version of Vim.
 	In its simplest form the value is just one font name.  When
 	the font cannot be found you will get an error message.  To try other
 	font names a list can be specified, font names separated with commas.
 	The first valid font is used.
 
 	Spaces after a comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name
 	precede it with a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra
 	backslash before a space and a backslash.  See also
 	|option-backslash|.  For example: >
 	    :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
 <	will make Vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails it
 	will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.
 
 	If none of the fonts can be loaded, Vim will keep the current setting.
 	If an empty font list is given, Vim will try using other resource
 	settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
 	will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
 	the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
 	will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.
 
 	For Win32 and Mac OS: >
 	    :set guifont=*
 <	will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.
 
 	The font name depends on the GUI used.
 
 	For Mac OSX you can use something like this: >
 	    :set guifont=Monaco:h10
 <
 	Note that the fonts must be mono-spaced (all characters have the same
 	width).
 
 	To preview a font on X11, you might be able to use the "xfontsel"
 	program.  The "xlsfonts" program gives a list of all available fonts.
 
 	For the Win32 GUI
 	- takes these options in the font name:
 		hXX - height is XX (points, can be floating-point)
 		wXX - width is XX (points, can be floating-point)
 		b   - bold
 		i   - italic
 		u   - underline
 		s   - strikeout
 		cXX - character set XX.  Valid charsets are: ANSI, ARABIC,
 		      BALTIC, CHINESEBIG5, DEFAULT, EASTEUROPE, GB2312, GREEK,
 		      HANGEUL, HEBREW, JOHAB, MAC, OEM, RUSSIAN, SHIFTJIS,
 		      SYMBOL, THAI, TURKISH, VIETNAMESE ANSI and BALTIC.
 		      Normally you would use "cDEFAULT".
 
 	  Use a `':'`  to separate the options.
 	- A `'_'`  can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
 	  backslashes to escape the spaces.
 	- Examples: >
 	    :set guifont=courier_new:h12:w5:b:cRUSSIAN
 	    :set guifont=Andale_Mono:h7.5:w4.5
 <

## guifontwide


```lua
string
```

 `'guifontwide'`  `'gfw'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	Comma-separated list of fonts to be used for double-width characters.
 	The first font that can be loaded is used.
 	Note: The size of these fonts must be exactly twice as wide as the one
 	specified with `'guifont'`  and the same height.
 
 	When `'guifont'`  has a valid font and `'guifontwide'`  is empty Vim will
 	attempt to set `'guifontwide'`  to a matching double-width font.

## guioptions


```lua
string
```

 `'guioptions'`  `'go'` 	string	(default "egmrLT"   (MS-Windows))
 			global
 	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim.  It is a
 	sequence of letters which describes what components and options of the
 	GUI should be used.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
 
 	Valid letters are as follows:
 
 	  `'a'` 	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
 		or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
 		the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
 		Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
 		applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
 		ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
 		application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
 		is automatically yanked into the "* selection register.
 		Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
 		applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
 		    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
 		windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
 		by a yank or delete operation for the "* register.
 		The same applies to the modeless selection.
 
 	  `'P'` 	Like autoselect but using the "+ register instead of the "*
 		register.
 
 	  `'A'` 	Autoselect for the modeless selection.  Like `'a'` , but only
 		applies to the modeless selection.
 
 		    `'guioptions'`    autoselect Visual  autoselect modeless ~
 			 ""		 -			 -
 			 "a"		yes			yes
 			 "A"		 -			yes
 			 "aA"		yes			yes
 
 
 	  `'c'` 	Use console dialogs instead of popup dialogs for simple
 		choices.
 
 	  `'d'` 	Use dark theme variant if available.
 
 	  `'e'` 	Add tab pages when indicated with `'showtabline'` .
 		`'guitablabel'`  can be used to change the text in the labels.
 		When `'e'`  is missing a non-GUI tab pages line may be used.
 		The GUI tabs are only supported on some systems, currently
 		Mac OS/X and MS-Windows.
 
 	  `'i'` 	Use a Vim icon.
 
 	  `'m'` 	Menu bar is present.
 
 	  `'M'` 	The system menu "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim" is not sourced.  Note
 		that this flag must be added in the vimrc file, before
 		switching on syntax or filetype recognition (when the |gvimrc|
 		file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded; the
 		`:syntax on` and `:filetype on` commands load the menu too).
 
 	  `'g'` 	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
 		`'g'`  is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.
 
 	  `'T'` 	Include Toolbar.  Currently only in Win32 GUI.
 
 	  `'r'` 	Right-hand scrollbar is always present.
 
 	  `'R'` 	Right-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
 		split window.
 
 	  `'l'` 	Left-hand scrollbar is always present.
 
 	  `'L'` 	Left-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
 		split window.
 
 	  `'b'` 	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present.  Its size depends on
 		the longest visible line, or on the cursor line if the `'h'` 
 		flag is included. |gui-horiz-scroll|
 
 	  `'h'` 	Limit horizontal scrollbar size to the length of the cursor
 		line.  Reduces computations. |gui-horiz-scroll|
 
 	And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
 	you really want to :-).  See |gui-scrollbars| for more information.
 
 
 	  `'v'` 	Use a vertical button layout for dialogs.  When not included,
 		a horizontal layout is preferred, but when it doesn't fit a
 		vertical layout is used anyway.  Not supported in GTK 3.
 
 	  `'p'` 	Use Pointer callbacks for X11 GUI.  This is required for some
 		window managers.  If the cursor is not blinking or hollow at
 		the right moment, try adding this flag.  This must be done
 		before starting the GUI.  Set it in your |gvimrc|.  Adding or
 		removing it after the GUI has started has no effect.
 
 	  `'k'` 	Keep the GUI window size when adding/removing a scrollbar, or
 		toolbar, tabline, etc.  Instead, the behavior is similar to
 		when the window is maximized and will adjust `'lines'`  and
 		`'columns'`  to fit to the window.  Without the `'k'`  flag Vim will
 		try to keep `'lines'`  and `'columns'`  the same when adding and
 		removing GUI components.

## guitablabel


```lua
string
```

 `'guitablabel'`  `'gtl'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty describes the text to use in a label of the GUI tab
 	pages line.  When empty and when the result is empty Vim will use a
 	default label.  See |setting-guitablabel| for more info.
 
 	The format of this option is like that of `'statusline'` .
 	`'guitabtooltip'`  is used for the tooltip, see below.
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	Only used when the GUI tab pages line is displayed.  `'e'`  must be
 	present in `'guioptions'` .  For the non-GUI tab pages line `'tabline'`  is
 	used.

## guitabtooltip


```lua
string
```

 `'guitabtooltip'`  `'gtt'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty describes the text to use in a tooltip for the GUI tab
 	pages line.  When empty Vim will use a default tooltip.
 	This option is otherwise just like `'guitablabel'`  above.
 	You can include a line break.  Simplest method is to use |:let|: >
 		:let &guitabtooltip = "line one\nline two"

## helpfile


```lua
string
```

 `'helpfile'`  `'hf'` 		string	(default (MS-Windows) "$VIMRUNTIME\doc\help.txt"
 					 (others) "$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt")
 			global
 	Name of the main help file.  All distributed help files should be
 	placed together in one directory.  Additionally, all "doc" directories
 	in `'runtimepath'`  will be used.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  For example:
 	"$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt".  If $VIMRUNTIME is not set, $VIM is also
 	tried.  Also see |$VIMRUNTIME| and |option-backslash| about including
 	spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## helpheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'helpheight'`  `'hh'` 	number	(default 20)
 			global
 	Minimal initial height of the help window when it is opened with the
 	":help" command.  The initial height of the help window is half of the
 	current window, or (when the `'ea'`  option is on) the same as other
 	windows.  When the height is less than `'helpheight'` , the height is
 	set to `'helpheight'` .  Set to zero to disable.

## helplang


```lua
string
```

 `'helplang'`  `'hlg'` 	string	(default: messages language or empty)
 			global
 	Comma-separated list of languages.  Vim will use the first language
 	for which the desired help can be found.  The English help will always
 	be used as a last resort.  You can add "en" to prefer English over
 	another language, but that will only find tags that exist in that
 	language and not in the English help.
 	Example: >
 		:set helplang=de,it
 <	This will first search German, then Italian and finally English help
 	files.
 	When using |CTRL-]| and ":help!" in a non-English help file Vim will
 	try to find the tag in the current language before using this option.
 	See |help-translated|.

## hf

 	Name of the main help file.  All distributed help files should be
 	placed together in one directory.  Additionally, all "doc" directories
 	in `'runtimepath'`  will be used.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  For example:
 	"$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt".  If $VIMRUNTIME is not set, $VIM is also
 	tried.  Also see |$VIMRUNTIME| and |option-backslash| about including
 	spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## hh


```lua
vim.opt.helpheight
```

 `'helpheight'`  `'hh'` 	number	(default 20)
 			global
 	Minimal initial height of the help window when it is opened with the
 	":help" command.  The initial height of the help window is half of the
 	current window, or (when the `'ea'`  option is on) the same as other
 	windows.  When the height is less than `'helpheight'` , the height is
 	set to `'helpheight'` .  Set to zero to disable.

## hi


```lua
vim.opt.history
```

 `'history'`  `'hi'` 		number	(default: 10000)
 			global
 	A history of ":" commands, and a history of previous search patterns
 	is remembered.  This option decides how many entries may be stored in
 	each of these histories (see |cmdline-editing|).
 	The maximum value is 10000.

## hid


```lua
vim.opt.hidden
```

 `'hidden'`  `'hid'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When off a buffer is unloaded (including loss of undo information)
 	when it is |abandon|ed.  When on a buffer becomes hidden when it is
 	|abandon|ed.  A buffer displayed in another window does not become
 	hidden, of course.
 
 	Commands that move through the buffer list sometimes hide a buffer
 	although the `'hidden'`  option is off when these three are true:
 	- the buffer is modified
 	- `'autowrite'`  is off or writing is not possible
 	- the `'!'`  flag was used
 	Also see |windows|.
 
 	To hide a specific buffer use the `'bufhidden'`  option.
 	`'hidden'`  is set for one command with ":hide {command}" |:hide|.

## hlg


```lua
vim.opt.helplang
```

 `'helplang'`  `'hlg'` 	string	(default: messages language or empty)
 			global
 	Comma-separated list of languages.  Vim will use the first language
 	for which the desired help can be found.  The English help will always
 	be used as a last resort.  You can add "en" to prefer English over
 	another language, but that will only find tags that exist in that
 	language and not in the English help.
 	Example: >
 		:set helplang=de,it
 <	This will first search German, then Italian and finally English help
 	files.
 	When using |CTRL-]| and ":help!" in a non-English help file Vim will
 	try to find the tag in the current language before using this option.
 	See |help-translated|.

## hls


```lua
vim.opt.hlsearch
```

 `'hlsearch'`  `'hls'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches.
 	The |hl-Search| highlight group determines the highlighting for all
 	matches not under the cursor while the |hl-CurSearch| highlight group
 	(if defined) determines the highlighting for the match under the
 	cursor. If |hl-CurSearch| is not defined, then |hl-Search| is used for
 	both. Note that only the matching text is highlighted, any offsets
 	are not applied.
 	See also: `'incsearch'`  and |:match|.
 	When you get bored looking at the highlighted matches, you can turn it
 	off with |:nohlsearch|.  This does not change the option value, as
 	soon as you use a search command, the highlighting comes back.
 	`'redrawtime'`  specifies the maximum time spent on finding matches.
 	When the search pattern can match an end-of-line, Vim will try to
 	highlight all of the matched text.  However, this depends on where the
 	search starts.  This will be the first line in the window or the first
 	line below a closed fold.  A match in a previous line which is not
 	drawn may not continue in a newly drawn line.
 	You can specify whether the highlight status is restored on startup
 	with the `'h'`  flag in `'shada'`  |shada-h|.

 			buffer.
 		split	Like "nosplit", but also shows partial off-screen
 			results in a preview window.
 
 	If the preview for built-in commands is too slow (exceeds
 	`'redrawtime'` ) then `'inccommand'`  is automatically disabled until
 	|Command-line-mode| is done.

## icon


```lua

 `'icon'` 			boolean	(default off, on when title can be restored)
 			global
 	When on, the icon text of the window will be set to the value of
 	`'iconstring'`  (if it is not empty), or to the name of the file
 	currently being edited.  Only the last part of the name is used.
 	Overridden by the `'iconstring'`  option.
 	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icons.

## iconstring


```lua
string
```

 `'iconstring'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the icon text of
 	the window.  This happens only when the `'icon'`  option is on.
 	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icon text
 	When this option contains printf-style `'%'`  items, they will be
 	expanded according to the rules used for `'statusline'` .  See

## inc


```lua
vim.opt.include
```

 `'include'`  `'inc'` 		string	(default "^\sinclude")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Pattern to be used to find an include command.  It is a search
 	pattern, just like for the "/" command (See |pattern|).  The default
 	value is for C programs.  This option is used for the commands "[i",
 	"]I", "[d", etc.
 	Normally the `'isfname'`  option is used to recognize the file name that
 	comes after the matched pattern.  But if "\zs" appears in the pattern
 	then the text matched from "\zs" to the end, or until "\ze" if it
 	appears, is used as the file name.  Use this to include characters
 	that are not in `'isfname'` , such as a space.  You can then use
 	`'includeexpr'`  to process the matched text.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

## inccommand


```lua

 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

## includeexpr


```lua
string
```

 `'includeexpr'`  `'inex'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression to be used to transform the string found with the `'include'` 
 	option to a file name.  Mostly useful to change "." to "/" for Java: >
 		:setlocal includeexpr=substitute(v:fname,`'\\.'` ,`'/'` ,`'g'` )
 <	The "v:fname" variable will be set to the file name that was detected.
 	Note the double backslash: the `:set` command first halves them, then
 	one remains in the value, where "\." matches a dot literally.  For
 	simple character replacements `tr()` avoids the need for escaping: >
 		:setlocal includeexpr=tr(v:fname,`'.'` ,`'/'` )
 <
 	Also used for the |gf| command if an unmodified file name can't be
 	found.  Allows doing "gf" on the name after an `'include'`  statement.
 	Also used for |<cfile>|.
 
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set includeexpr=s:MyIncludeExpr(v:fname)
 		set includeexpr=<SID>SomeIncludeExpr(v:fname)
 <
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'includeexpr'`  |textlock|.

## incsearch


```lua
boolean
```

 `'incsearch'`  `'is'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed
 	so far, matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the pattern
 	is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will be updated
 	often, this is only useful on fast terminals.
 	Note that the match will be shown, but the cursor will return to its
 	original position when no match is found and when pressing <Esc>.  You
 	still need to finish the search command with <Enter> to move the
 	cursor to the match.
 	You can use the CTRL-G and CTRL-T keys to move to the next and
 	previous match. |c_CTRL-G| |c_CTRL-T|
 	Vim only searches for about half a second.  With a complicated
 	pattern and/or a lot of text the match may not be found.  This is to
 	avoid that Vim hangs while you are typing the pattern.
 	The |hl-IncSearch| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	When `'hlsearch'`  is on, all matched strings are highlighted too while
 	typing a search command. See also: `'hlsearch'` .
 	If you don't want to turn `'hlsearch'`  on, but want to highlight all
 	matches while searching, you can turn on and off `'hlsearch'`  with
 	autocmd.  Example: >
 		augroup vimrc-incsearch-highlight
 		  autocmd!
 		  autocmd CmdlineEnter /,\? :set hlsearch
 		  autocmd CmdlineLeave /,\? :set nohlsearch
 		augroup END
 <
 	CTRL-L can be used to add one character from after the current match
 	to the command line.  If `'ignorecase'`  and `'smartcase'`  are set and the
 	command line has no uppercase characters, the added character is
 	converted to lowercase.
 	CTRL-R CTRL-W can be used to add the word at the end of the current
 	match, excluding the characters that were already typed.

## inde


```lua
vim.opt.indentexpr
```

 `'indentexpr'`  `'inde'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression which is evaluated to obtain the proper indent for a line.
 	It is used when a new line is created, for the |=| operator and
 	in Insert mode as specified with the `'indentkeys'`  option.
 	When this option is not empty, it overrules the `'cindent'`  and
 	`'smartindent'`  indenting.  When `'lisp'`  is set, this option is
 	is only used when `'lispoptions'`  contains "expr:1".
 	The expression is evaluated with |v:lnum| set to the line number for
 	which the indent is to be computed.  The cursor is also in this line
 	when the expression is evaluated (but it may be moved around).
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set indentexpr=s:MyIndentExpr()
 		set indentexpr=<SID>SomeIndentExpr()
 <
 	The expression must return the number of spaces worth of indent.  It
 	can return "-1" to keep the current indent (this means `'autoindent'`  is
 	used for the indent).
 	Functions useful for computing the indent are |indent()|, |cindent()|
 	and |lispindent()|.
 	The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!  It must
 	not change the text, jump to another window, etc.  Afterwards the
 	cursor position is always restored, thus the cursor may be moved.
 	Normally this option would be set to call a function: >
 		:set indentexpr=GetMyIndent()
 <	Error messages will be suppressed, unless the `'debug'`  option contains
 	"msg".
 	See |indent-expression|.
 
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while

 	where the match has an upper case letter, the completed part is made
 	lowercase.  If the typed text has no lowercase letters and the match
 	has a lowercase letter where the typed text has an uppercase letter,
 	and there is a letter before it, the completed part is made uppercase.
 	With `'noinfercase'`  the match is used as-is.

## infercase


```lua
boolean

 `'infercase'`  `'inf'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When doing keyword completion in insert mode |ins-completion|, and
 	`'ignorecase'`  is also on, the case of the match is adjusted depending
 	on the typed text.  If the typed text contains a lowercase letter
 	where the match has an upper case letter, the completed part is made
 	lowercase.  If the typed text has no lowercase letters and the match
 	has a lowercase letter where the typed text has an uppercase letter,
 	and there is a letter before it, the completed part is made uppercase.
 	With `'noinfercase'`  the match is used as-is.

## insertmode

## is


```lua
vim.opt.incsearch
```

 `'incsearch'`  `'is'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed
 	so far, matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the pattern
 	is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will be updated
 	often, this is only useful on fast terminals.
 	Note that the match will be shown, but the cursor will return to its
 	original position when no match is found and when pressing <Esc>.  You
 	still need to finish the search command with <Enter> to move the
 	cursor to the match.
 	You can use the CTRL-G and CTRL-T keys to move to the next and
 	previous match. |c_CTRL-G| |c_CTRL-T|
 	Vim only searches for about half a second.  With a complicated
 	pattern and/or a lot of text the match may not be found.  This is to
 	avoid that Vim hangs while you are typing the pattern.
 	The |hl-IncSearch| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	When `'hlsearch'`  is on, all matched strings are highlighted too while
 	typing a search command. See also: `'hlsearch'` .
 	If you don't want to turn `'hlsearch'`  on, but want to highlight all
 	matches while searching, you can turn on and off `'hlsearch'`  with
 	autocmd.  Example: >
 		augroup vimrc-incsearch-highlight
 		  autocmd!
 		  autocmd CmdlineEnter /,\? :set hlsearch
 		  autocmd CmdlineLeave /,\? :set nohlsearch
 		augroup END
 <
 	CTRL-L can be used to add one character from after the current match
 	to the command line.  If `'ignorecase'`  and `'smartcase'`  are set and the
 	command line has no uppercase characters, the added character is
 	converted to lowercase.
 	CTRL-R CTRL-W can be used to add the word at the end of the current
 	match, excluding the characters that were already typed.

## isf


```lua
vim.opt.isfname
```

 `'isfname'`  `'isf'` 		string	(default for Windows:

 			    otherwise: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=")
 			global
 	The characters specified by this option are included in file names and
 	path names.  Filenames are used for commands like "gf", "[i" and in
 	the tags file.  It is also used for "\f" in a |pattern|.
 	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
 	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.
 	For UTF-8 the characters 0xa0 to 0xff are included as well.
 	Think twice before adding white space to this option.  Although a
 	space may appear inside a file name, the effect will be that Vim
 	doesn't know where a file name starts or ends when doing completion.
 	It most likely works better without a space in `'isfname'` .
 
 	Note that on systems using a backslash as path separator, Vim tries to
 	do its best to make it work as you would expect.  That is a bit
 	tricky, since Vi originally used the backslash to escape special
 	characters.  Vim will not remove a backslash in front of a normal file
 	name character on these systems, but it will on Unix and alikes.  The
 	`'&'`  and `'^'`  are not included by default, because these are special for
 	cmd.exe.
 
 	The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
 	Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
 	character numbers with `'-'`  in between.  A character number can be a
 	decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
 	not work for digits).  Example:
 		"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include `'_'`  and `'-'`  and the range
 					128 to 140 and `'#'`  to 43)
 	If a part starts with `'^'` , the following character number or range
 	will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
 	to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
 	included.  To include `'^'`  itself use it as the last character of the
 	option or the end of a range.  Example:
 		"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude `'a'`  to `'z'` , include `'#'`  and `'^'` )
 	If the character is `'@'` , all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
 	are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
 	plus accented characters.  To include `'@'`  itself use "@-@".  Examples:
 		"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
 				case ASCII letters.
 		"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the `'@'`  character.
 	A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
 	expected.  Example:
 		"48-57,,,_"	Digits, comma and underscore.
 	A comma can be excluded by prepending a `'^'` .  Example:
 		" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to `'~'` , excluding
 				comma, plus <Tab>.

## langmap


```lua
string
```

 `'langmap'`  `'lmap'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This option allows switching your keyboard into a special language
 	mode.  When you are typing text in Insert mode the characters are
 	inserted directly.  When in Normal mode the `'langmap'`  option takes
 	care of translating these special characters to the original meaning
 	of the key.  This means you don't have to change the keyboard mode to
 	be able to execute Normal mode commands.
 	This is the opposite of the `'keymap'`  option, where characters are
 	mapped in Insert mode.
 	Also consider setting `'langremap'`  to off, to prevent `'langmap'`  from
 	applying to characters resulting from a mapping.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.
 
 	Example (for Greek, in UTF-8):				  >
 	    :set langmap=ΑA,ΒB,ΨC,ΔD,ΕE,ΦF,ΓG,ΗH,ΙI,ΞJ,ΚK,ΛL,ΜM,ΝN,ΟO,ΠP,QQ,ΡR,ΣS,ΤT,ΘU,ΩV,WW,ΧX,ΥY,ΖZ,αa,βb,ψc,δd,εe,φf,γg,ηh,ιi,ξj,κk,λl,μm,νn,οo,πp,qq,ρr,σs,τt,θu,ωv,ςw,χx,υy,ζz
 <	Example (exchanges meaning of z and y for commands): >
 	    :set langmap=zy,yz,ZY,YZ
 <
 	The `'langmap'`  option is a list of parts, separated with commas.  Each
 	part can be in one of two forms:
 	1.  A list of pairs.  Each pair is a "from" character immediately
 	    followed by the "to" character.  Examples: "aA", "aAbBcC".
 	2.  A list of "from" characters, a semi-colon and a list of "to"
 	    characters.  Example: "abc;ABC"
 	Example: "aA,fgh;FGH,cCdDeE"
 	Special characters need to be preceded with a backslash.  These are
 	";", `','` , `'"'` , `'|'`  and backslash itself.
 
 	This will allow you to activate vim actions without having to switch
 	back and forth between the languages.  Your language characters will
 	be understood as normal vim English characters (according to the
 	langmap mappings) in the following cases:
 	 o Normal/Visual mode (commands, buffer/register names, user mappings)
 	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Register names after CTRL-R
 	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Mappings
 	Characters entered in Command-line mode will NOT be affected by
 	this option.   Note that this option can be changed at any time
 	allowing to switch between mappings for different languages/encodings.
 	Use a mapping to avoid having to type it each time!

## langmenu


```lua
string
```

 `'langmenu'`  `'lm'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	Language to use for menu translation.  Tells which file is loaded
 	from the "lang" directory in `'runtimepath'` : >
 		"lang/menu_" .. &langmenu .. ".vim"
 <	(without the spaces).  For example, to always use the Dutch menus, no
 	matter what $LANG is set to: >
 		:set langmenu=nl_NL.ISO_8859-1
 <	When `'langmenu'`  is empty, |v:lang| is used.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
 	If your $LANG is set to a non-English language but you do want to use
 	the English menus: >
 		:set langmenu=none
 <	This option must be set before loading menus, switching on filetype
 	detection or syntax highlighting.  Once the menus are defined setting
 	this option has no effect.  But you could do this: >
 		:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
 		:set langmenu=de_DE.ISO_8859-1
 		:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
 <	Warning: This deletes all menus that you defined yourself!

## langnoremap


```lua
boolean
```

## langremap


```lua
boolean
```

 `'langremap'`  `'lrm'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When off, setting `'langmap'`  does not apply to characters resulting from
 	a mapping.  If setting `'langmap'`  disables some of your mappings, make
 	sure this option is off.

## laststatus


```lua
integer
```

 `'laststatus'`  `'ls'` 	number	(default 2)
 			global
 	The value of this option influences when the last window will have a
 	status line:
 		0: never
 		1: only if there are at least two windows
 		2: always
 		3: always and ONLY the last window
 	The screen looks nicer with a status line if you have several
 	windows, but it takes another screen line. |status-line|

 `'lazyredraw'`  `'lz'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When this option is set, the screen will not be redrawn while
 	executing macros, registers and other commands that have not been
 	typed.  Also, updating the window title is postponed.  To force an
 	update use |:redraw|.
 	This may occasionally cause display errors.  It is only meant to be set
 	temporarily when performing an operation where redrawing may cause
 	flickering or cause a slow down.

## lbr


```lua
vim.opt.linebreak
```

 `'linebreak'`  `'lbr'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	If on, Vim will wrap long lines at a character in `'breakat'`  rather
 	than at the last character that fits on the screen.  Unlike
 	`'wrapmargin'`  and `'textwidth'` , this does not insert <EOL>s in the file,
 	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.
 	If `'breakindent'`  is set, line is visually indented. Then, the value
 	of `'showbreak'`  is used to put in front of wrapped lines. This option
 	is not used when the `'wrap'`  option is off.
 	Note that <Tab> characters after an <EOL> are mostly not displayed
 	with the right amount of white space.

## lcs


```lua
vim.opt.listchars
```

 `'listchars'`  `'lcs'` 	string	(default: "tab:> ,trail:-,nbsp:+")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Strings to use in `'list'`  mode and for the |:list| command.  It is a
 	comma-separated list of string settings.
 
 
 	  eol:c		Character to show at the end of each line.  When
 			omitted, there is no extra character at the end of the
 			line.
 
 	  tab:xy[z]	Two or three characters to be used to show a tab.
 			The third character is optional.
 
 	  tab:xy	The `'x'`  is always used, then `'y'`  as many times as will
 			fit.  Thus "tab:>-" displays: >
 				>
 				>-
 				>--
 				etc.
 <
 	  tab:xyz	The `'z'`  is always used, then `'x'`  is prepended, and
 			then `'y'`  is used as many times as will fit.  Thus
 			"tab:<->" displays: >
 				>
 				<>
 				<->
 				<-->
 				etc.
 <
 			When "tab:" is omitted, a tab is shown as ^I.
 
 	  space:c	Character to show for a space.  When omitted, spaces
 			are left blank.
 
 	  multispace:c...
 			One or more characters to use cyclically to show for
 			multiple consecutive spaces.  Overrides the "space"
 			setting, except for single spaces.  When omitted, the
 			"space" setting is used.  For example,
 			`:set listchars=multispace:---+` shows ten consecutive
 			spaces as: >
 				---+---+--
 <
 
 	  lead:c	Character to show for leading spaces.  When omitted,
 			leading spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
 			"multispace" settings for leading spaces.  You can
 			combine it with "tab:", for example: >
 				:set listchars+=tab:>-,lead:.
 <
 
 	  leadmultispace:c...
 			Like the |lcs-multispace| value, but for leading
 			spaces only.  Also overrides |lcs-lead| for leading
 			multiple spaces.
 			`:set listchars=leadmultispace:---+` shows ten
 			consecutive leading spaces as: >
 				---+---+--XXX
 <
 			Where "XXX" denotes the first non-blank characters in
 			the line.
 
 	  trail:c	Character to show for trailing spaces.  When omitted,
 			trailing spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
 			"multispace" settings for trailing spaces.
 
 	  extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when `'wrap'`  is
 			off and the line continues beyond the right of the
 			screen.
 
 	  precedes:c	Character to show in the first visible column of the
 			physical line, when there is text preceding the
 			character visible in the first column.
 
 	  conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
 			`'conceallevel'`  is set to 1.  A space when omitted.
 
 	  nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space character
 			(0xA0 (160 decimal) and U+202F).  Left blank when
 			omitted.
 
 	The characters `':'`  and `','`  should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can
 	be used.  All characters must be single width.
 
 	Each character can be specified as hex: >
 		set listchars=eol:\\x24
 		set listchars=eol:\\u21b5
 		set listchars=eol:\\U000021b5
 <	Note that a double backslash is used.  The number of hex characters
 	must be exactly 2 for \\x, 4 for \\u and 8 for \\U.
 
 	Examples: >
 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,trail:-
 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,eol:<,nbsp:%
 	    :set lcs=extends:>,precedes:<
 <	|hl-NonText| highlighting will be used for "eol", "extends" and
 	"precedes". |hl-Whitespace| for "nbsp", "space", "tab", "multispace",
 	"lead" and "trail".

## linebreak


```lua
boolean
```

 `'linebreak'`  `'lbr'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	If on, Vim will wrap long lines at a character in `'breakat'`  rather
 	than at the last character that fits on the screen.  Unlike
 	`'wrapmargin'`  and `'textwidth'` , this does not insert <EOL>s in the file,
 	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.
 	If `'breakindent'`  is set, line is visually indented. Then, the value
 	of `'showbreak'`  is used to put in front of wrapped lines. This option
 	is not used when the `'wrap'`  option is off.
 	Note that <Tab> characters after an <EOL> are mostly not displayed
 	with the right amount of white space.

## lines


```lua
integer
```

 `'lines'` 			number	(default 24 or terminal height)
 			global
 	Number of lines of the Vim window.
 	Normally you don't need to set this.  It is done automatically by the
 	terminal initialization code.
 	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
 	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
 	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |gvimrc| file.
 	Vim limits the number of lines to what fits on the screen.  You can
 	use this command to get the tallest window possible: >
 		:set lines=999
 <	Minimum value is 2, maximum value is 1000.

## linespace


```lua
integer
```

 `'linespace'`  `'lsp'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 			{only in the GUI}
 	Number of pixel lines inserted between characters.  Useful if the font
 	uses the full character cell height, making lines touch each other.
 	When non-zero there is room for underlining.
 	With some fonts there can be too much room between lines (to have
 	space for ascents and descents).  Then it makes sense to set
 	`'linespace'`  to a negative value.  This may cause display problems
 	though!

## lisp


```lua
boolean
```

 `'lisp'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Lisp mode: When <Enter> is typed in insert mode set the indent for
 	the next line to Lisp standards (well, sort of).  Also happens with
 	"cc" or "S".  `'autoindent'`  must also be on for this to work.  The `'p'` 
 	flag in `'cpoptions'`  changes the method of indenting: Vi compatible or
 	better.  Also see `'lispwords'` .
 	The `'-'`  character is included in keyword characters.  Redefines the
 	"=" operator to use this same indentation algorithm rather than
 	calling an external program if `'equalprg'`  is empty.

## lispoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'lispoptions'`  `'lop'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Comma-separated list of items that influence the Lisp indenting when
 	enabled with the |`'lisp'` | option.  Currently only one item is
 	supported:
 		expr:1	use `'indentexpr'`  for Lisp indenting when it is set
 		expr:0	do not use `'indentexpr'`  for Lisp indenting (default)
 	Note that when using `'indentexpr'`  the `=` operator indents all the
 	lines, otherwise the first line is not indented (Vi-compatible).

## lispwords


```lua
string
```

 `'lispwords'`  `'lw'` 	string	(default is very long)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Comma-separated list of words that influence the Lisp indenting when
 	enabled with the |`'lisp'` | option.

## list


```lua
boolean
```

 `'list'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	List mode: By default, show tabs as ">", trailing spaces as "-", and
 	non-breakable space characters as "+". Useful to see the difference
 	between tabs and spaces and for trailing blanks. Further changed by
 	the `'listchars'`  option.
 
 	The cursor is displayed at the start of the space a Tab character
 	occupies, not at the end as usual in Normal mode.  To get this cursor
 	position while displaying Tabs with spaces, use: >
 		:set list lcs=tab:\ \
 <
 	Note that list mode will also affect formatting (set with `'textwidth'` 
 	or `'wrapmargin'` ) when `'cpoptions'`  includes `'L'` .  See `'listchars'`  for
 	changing the way tabs are displayed.

## listchars


```lua
string
```

 `'listchars'`  `'lcs'` 	string	(default: "tab:> ,trail:-,nbsp:+")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Strings to use in `'list'`  mode and for the |:list| command.  It is a
 	comma-separated list of string settings.
 
 
 	  eol:c		Character to show at the end of each line.  When
 			omitted, there is no extra character at the end of the
 			line.
 
 	  tab:xy[z]	Two or three characters to be used to show a tab.
 			The third character is optional.
 
 	  tab:xy	The `'x'`  is always used, then `'y'`  as many times as will
 			fit.  Thus "tab:>-" displays: >
 				>
 				>-
 				>--
 				etc.
 <
 	  tab:xyz	The `'z'`  is always used, then `'x'`  is prepended, and
 			then `'y'`  is used as many times as will fit.  Thus
 			"tab:<->" displays: >
 				>
 				<>
 				<->
 				<-->
 				etc.
 <
 			When "tab:" is omitted, a tab is shown as ^I.
 
 	  space:c	Character to show for a space.  When omitted, spaces
 			are left blank.
 
 	  multispace:c...
 			One or more characters to use cyclically to show for
 			multiple consecutive spaces.  Overrides the "space"
 			setting, except for single spaces.  When omitted, the
 			"space" setting is used.  For example,
 			`:set listchars=multispace:---+` shows ten consecutive
 			spaces as: >
 				---+---+--
 <
 
 	  lead:c	Character to show for leading spaces.  When omitted,
 			leading spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
 			"multispace" settings for leading spaces.  You can
 			combine it with "tab:", for example: >
 				:set listchars+=tab:>-,lead:.
 <
 
 	  leadmultispace:c...
 			Like the |lcs-multispace| value, but for leading
 			spaces only.  Also overrides |lcs-lead| for leading
 			multiple spaces.
 			`:set listchars=leadmultispace:---+` shows ten
 			consecutive leading spaces as: >
 				---+---+--XXX
 <
 			Where "XXX" denotes the first non-blank characters in
 			the line.
 
 	  trail:c	Character to show for trailing spaces.  When omitted,
 			trailing spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
 			"multispace" settings for trailing spaces.
 
 	  extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when `'wrap'`  is
 			off and the line continues beyond the right of the
 			screen.
 
 	  precedes:c	Character to show in the first visible column of the
 			physical line, when there is text preceding the
 			character visible in the first column.
 
 	  conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
 			`'conceallevel'`  is set to 1.  A space when omitted.
 
 	  nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space character
 			(0xA0 (160 decimal) and U+202F).  Left blank when
 			omitted.
 
 	The characters `':'`  and `','`  should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can
 	be used.  All characters must be single width.
 
 	Each character can be specified as hex: >
 		set listchars=eol:\\x24
 		set listchars=eol:\\u21b5
 		set listchars=eol:\\U000021b5
 <	Note that a double backslash is used.  The number of hex characters
 	must be exactly 2 for \\x, 4 for \\u and 8 for \\U.
 
 	Examples: >
 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,trail:-
 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,eol:<,nbsp:%
 	    :set lcs=extends:>,precedes:<
 <	|hl-NonText| highlighting will be used for "eol", "extends" and
 	"precedes". |hl-Whitespace| for "nbsp", "space", "tab", "multispace",
 	"lead" and "trail".

## lm


```lua
vim.opt.langmenu
```

 `'langmenu'`  `'lm'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	Language to use for menu translation.  Tells which file is loaded
 	from the "lang" directory in `'runtimepath'` : >
 		"lang/menu_" .. &langmenu .. ".vim"
 <	(without the spaces).  For example, to always use the Dutch menus, no
 	matter what $LANG is set to: >
 		:set langmenu=nl_NL.ISO_8859-1
 <	When `'langmenu'`  is empty, |v:lang| is used.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
 	If your $LANG is set to a non-English language but you do want to use
 	the English menus: >
 		:set langmenu=none
 <	This option must be set before loading menus, switching on filetype
 	detection or syntax highlighting.  Once the menus are defined setting
 	this option has no effect.  But you could do this: >
 		:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
 		:set langmenu=de_DE.ISO_8859-1
 		:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
 <	Warning: This deletes all menus that you defined yourself!

## lmap


```lua
vim.opt.langmap
```

 `'langmap'`  `'lmap'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This option allows switching your keyboard into a special language
 	mode.  When you are typing text in Insert mode the characters are
 	inserted directly.  When in Normal mode the `'langmap'`  option takes
 	care of translating these special characters to the original meaning
 	of the key.  This means you don't have to change the keyboard mode to
 	be able to execute Normal mode commands.
 	This is the opposite of the `'keymap'`  option, where characters are
 	mapped in Insert mode.
 	Also consider setting `'langremap'`  to off, to prevent `'langmap'`  from
 	applying to characters resulting from a mapping.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.
 
 	Example (for Greek, in UTF-8):				  >
 	    :set langmap=ΑA,ΒB,ΨC,ΔD,ΕE,ΦF,ΓG,ΗH,ΙI,ΞJ,ΚK,ΛL,ΜM,ΝN,ΟO,ΠP,QQ,ΡR,ΣS,ΤT,ΘU,ΩV,WW,ΧX,ΥY,ΖZ,αa,βb,ψc,δd,εe,φf,γg,ηh,ιi,ξj,κk,λl,μm,νn,οo,πp,qq,ρr,σs,τt,θu,ωv,ςw,χx,υy,ζz
 <	Example (exchanges meaning of z and y for commands): >
 	    :set langmap=zy,yz,ZY,YZ
 <
 	The `'langmap'`  option is a list of parts, separated with commas.  Each
 	part can be in one of two forms:
 	1.  A list of pairs.  Each pair is a "from" character immediately
 	    followed by the "to" character.  Examples: "aA", "aAbBcC".
 	2.  A list of "from" characters, a semi-colon and a list of "to"
 	    characters.  Example: "abc;ABC"
 	Example: "aA,fgh;FGH,cCdDeE"
 	Special characters need to be preceded with a backslash.  These are
 	";", `','` , `'"'` , `'|'`  and backslash itself.
 
 	This will allow you to activate vim actions without having to switch
 	back and forth between the languages.  Your language characters will
 	be understood as normal vim English characters (according to the
 	langmap mappings) in the following cases:
 	 o Normal/Visual mode (commands, buffer/register names, user mappings)
 	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Register names after CTRL-R
 	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Mappings
 	Characters entered in Command-line mode will NOT be affected by
 	this option.   Note that this option can be changed at any time
 	allowing to switch between mappings for different languages/encodings.
 	Use a mapping to avoid having to type it each time!

## lnr


```lua
vim.opt.langnoremap
```

## loadplugins


```lua
boolean
```

 `'loadplugins'`  `'lpl'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on the plugin scripts are loaded when starting up |load-plugins|.
 	This option can be reset in your |vimrc| file to disable the loading
 	of plugins.
 	Note that using the "-u NONE" and "--noplugin" command line arguments
 	reset this option. |-u| |--noplugin|

## lop


```lua
vim.opt.lispoptions
```

 `'lispoptions'`  `'lop'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Comma-separated list of items that influence the Lisp indenting when
 	enabled with the |`'lisp'` | option.  Currently only one item is
 	supported:
 		expr:1	use `'indentexpr'`  for Lisp indenting when it is set
 		expr:0	do not use `'indentexpr'`  for Lisp indenting (default)
 	Note that when using `'indentexpr'`  the `=` operator indents all the
 	lines, otherwise the first line is not indented (Vi-compatible).

## lpl


```lua
vim.opt.loadplugins
```

 `'loadplugins'`  `'lpl'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on the plugin scripts are loaded when starting up |load-plugins|.
 	This option can be reset in your |vimrc| file to disable the loading
 	of plugins.
 	Note that using the "-u NONE" and "--noplugin" command line arguments
 	reset this option. |-u| |--noplugin|

## lrm


```lua
vim.opt.langremap
```

 `'langremap'`  `'lrm'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When off, setting `'langmap'`  does not apply to characters resulting from
 	a mapping.  If setting `'langmap'`  disables some of your mappings, make
 	sure this option is off.

## ls


```lua
vim.opt.laststatus
```

 `'laststatus'`  `'ls'` 	number	(default 2)
 			global
 	The value of this option influences when the last window will have a
 	status line:
 		0: never
 		1: only if there are at least two windows
 		2: always
 		3: always and ONLY the last window
 	The screen looks nicer with a status line if you have several
 	windows, but it takes another screen line. |status-line|

## lsp


```lua
vim.opt.linespace
```

 `'linespace'`  `'lsp'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 			{only in the GUI}
 	Number of pixel lines inserted between characters.  Useful if the font
 	uses the full character cell height, making lines touch each other.
 	When non-zero there is room for underlining.
 	With some fonts there can be too much room between lines (to have
 	space for ascents and descents).  Then it makes sense to set
 	`'linespace'`  to a negative value.  This may cause display problems
 	though!

## lw


```lua
vim.opt.lispwords
```

 `'lispwords'`  `'lw'` 	string	(default is very long)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Comma-separated list of words that influence the Lisp indenting when
 	enabled with the |`'lisp'` | option.

## lz


```lua
vim.opt.lazyredraw
```

 `'lazyredraw'`  `'lz'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When this option is set, the screen will not be redrawn while
 	executing macros, registers and other commands that have not been
 	typed.  Also, updating the window title is postponed.  To force an
 	update use |:redraw|.
 	This may occasionally cause display errors.  It is only meant to be set
 	temporarily when performing an operation where redrawing may cause
 	flickering or cause a slow down.

## ma


```lua
vim.opt.modifiable
```

 `'modifiable'`  `'ma'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	When off the buffer contents cannot be changed.  The `'fileformat'`  and
 	`'fileencoding'`  options also can't be changed.
 	Can be reset on startup with the |-M| command line argument.

## magic


```lua
boolean
```

 `'magic'` 			boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Changes the special characters that can be used in search patterns.
 	See |pattern|.
 	WARNING: Switching this option off most likely breaks plugins!  That
 	is because many patterns assume it's on and will fail when it's off.
 	Only switch it off when working with old Vi scripts.  In any other
 	situation write patterns that work when `'magic'`  is on.  Include "\M"
 	when you want to |/\M|.

## makeef


```lua
string
```

 `'makeef'`  `'mef'` 		string	(default: "")
 			global
 	Name of the errorfile for the |:make| command (see |:make_makeprg|)
 	and the |:grep| command.
 	When it is empty, an internally generated temp file will be used.
 	When "##" is included, it is replaced by a number to make the name
 	unique.  This makes sure that the ":make" command doesn't overwrite an
 	existing file.
 	NOT used for the ":cf" command.  See `'errorfile'`  for that.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## makeencoding


```lua
string
```

 `'makeencoding'`  `'menc'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Encoding used for reading the output of external commands.  When empty,
 	encoding is not converted.
 	This is used for `:make`, `:lmake`, `:grep`, `:lgrep`, `:grepadd`,
 	`:lgrepadd`, `:cfile`, `:cgetfile`, `:caddfile`, `:lfile`, `:lgetfile`,
 	and `:laddfile`.
 
 	This would be mostly useful when you use MS-Windows.  If iconv is
 	enabled, setting `'makeencoding'`  to "char" has the same effect as
 	setting to the system locale encoding.  Example: >
 		:set makeencoding=char	" system locale is used
 <

## makeprg


```lua
string
```

 `'makeprg'`  `'mp'` 		string	(default "make")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Program to use for the ":make" command.  See |:make_makeprg|.
 	This option may contain `'%'`  and `'#'`  characters (see  |:_%| and |:_#|),
 	which are expanded to the current and alternate file name.  Use |::S|
 	to escape file names in case they contain special characters.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
 	about including spaces and backslashes.
 	Note that a `'|'`  must be escaped twice: once for ":set" and once for
 	the interpretation of a command.  When you use a filter called
 	"myfilter" do it like this: >
 	    :set makeprg=gmake\ \\\|\ myfilter
 <	The placeholder "$*" can be given (even multiple times) to specify
 	where the arguments will be included, for example: >
 	    :set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## mat


```lua
vim.opt.matchtime
```

 `'matchtime'`  `'mat'` 	number	(default 5)
 			global
 	Tenths of a second to show the matching paren, when `'showmatch'`  is
 	set.  Note that this is not in milliseconds, like other options that
 	set a time.  This is to be compatible with Nvi.

## matchpairs


```lua
string
```

 `'matchpairs'`  `'mps'` 	string	(default "(:),{:},[:]")
 			local to buffer
 	Characters that form pairs.  The |%| command jumps from one to the
 	other.
 	Only character pairs are allowed that are different, thus you cannot
 	jump between two double quotes.
 	The characters must be separated by a colon.
 	The pairs must be separated by a comma.  Example for including `'<'`  and
 	`'>'`  (for HTML): >
 		:set mps+=<:>
 
 <	A more exotic example, to jump between the `'='`  and `';'`  in an
 	assignment, useful for languages like C and Java: >
 		:au FileType c,cpp,java set mps+==:;
 
 <	For a more advanced way of using "%", see the matchit.vim plugin in
 	the $VIMRUNTIME/plugin directory. |add-local-help|

## matchtime


```lua
integer
```

 `'matchtime'`  `'mat'` 	number	(default 5)
 			global
 	Tenths of a second to show the matching paren, when `'showmatch'`  is
 	set.  Note that this is not in milliseconds, like other options that
 	set a time.  This is to be compatible with Nvi.

## maxcombine


```lua
integer
```

## maxfuncdepth


```lua
integer
```

 `'maxfuncdepth'`  `'mfd'` 	number	(default 100)
 			global
 	Maximum depth of function calls for user functions.  This normally
 	catches endless recursion.  When using a recursive function with
 	more depth, set `'maxfuncdepth'`  to a bigger number.  But this will use
 	more memory, there is the danger of failing when memory is exhausted.
 	Increasing this limit above 200 also changes the maximum for Ex
 	command recursion, see |E169|.
 	See also |:function|.

## maxmapdepth


```lua
integer
```

 `'maxmapdepth'`  `'mmd'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global
 	Maximum number of times a mapping is done without resulting in a
 	character to be used.  This normally catches endless mappings, like
 	":map x y" with ":map y x".  It still does not catch ":map g wg",
 	because the `'w'`  is used before the next mapping is done.  See also
 	|key-mapping|.

## maxmempattern


```lua
integer
```

 `'maxmempattern'`  `'mmp'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global
 	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for pattern matching.
 	The maximum value is about 2000000.  Use this to work without a limit.
 
 	When Vim runs into the limit it gives an error message and mostly
 	behaves like CTRL-C was typed.
 	Running into the limit often means that the pattern is very
 	inefficient or too complex.  This may already happen with the pattern
 	"\(.\)*" on a very long line.  ".*" works much better.
 	Might also happen on redraw, when syntax rules try to match a complex
 	text structure.
 	Vim may run out of memory before hitting the `'maxmempattern'`  limit, in
 	which case you get an "Out of memory" error instead.

## mco


```lua
vim.opt.maxcombine
```

## mef


```lua
vim.opt.makeef
```

 `'makeef'`  `'mef'` 		string	(default: "")
 			global
 	Name of the errorfile for the |:make| command (see |:make_makeprg|)
 	and the |:grep| command.
 	When it is empty, an internally generated temp file will be used.
 	When "##" is included, it is replaced by a number to make the name
 	unique.  This makes sure that the ":make" command doesn't overwrite an
 	existing file.
 	NOT used for the ":cf" command.  See `'errorfile'`  for that.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## menc


```lua
vim.opt.makeencoding
```

 `'makeencoding'`  `'menc'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Encoding used for reading the output of external commands.  When empty,
 	encoding is not converted.
 	This is used for `:make`, `:lmake`, `:grep`, `:lgrep`, `:grepadd`,
 	`:lgrepadd`, `:cfile`, `:cgetfile`, `:caddfile`, `:lfile`, `:lgetfile`,
 	and `:laddfile`.
 
 	This would be mostly useful when you use MS-Windows.  If iconv is
 	enabled, setting `'makeencoding'`  to "char" has the same effect as
 	setting to the system locale encoding.  Example: >
 		:set makeencoding=char	" system locale is used
 <

## menuitems


```lua
integer
```

 `'menuitems'`  `'mis'` 	number	(default 25)
 			global
 	Maximum number of items to use in a menu.  Used for menus that are
 	generated from a list of items, e.g., the Buffers menu.  Changing this
 	option has no direct effect, the menu must be refreshed first.

## mfd


```lua
vim.opt.maxfuncdepth
```

 `'maxfuncdepth'`  `'mfd'` 	number	(default 100)
 			global
 	Maximum depth of function calls for user functions.  This normally
 	catches endless recursion.  When using a recursive function with
 	more depth, set `'maxfuncdepth'`  to a bigger number.  But this will use
 	more memory, there is the danger of failing when memory is exhausted.
 	Increasing this limit above 200 also changes the maximum for Ex
 	command recursion, see |E169|.
 	See also |:function|.

## mh


```lua
vim.opt.mousehide
```

 `'mousehide'`  `'mh'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 			{only works in the GUI}
 	When on, the mouse pointer is hidden when characters are typed.
 	The mouse pointer is restored when the mouse is moved.

## mis


```lua
vim.opt.menuitems
```

 `'menuitems'`  `'mis'` 	number	(default 25)
 			global
 	Maximum number of items to use in a menu.  Used for menus that are
 	generated from a list of items, e.g., the Buffers menu.  Changing this
 	option has no direct effect, the menu must be refreshed first.

## mkspellmem


```lua
string
```

 `'mkspellmem'`  `'msm'` 	string	(default "460000,2000,500")
 			global
 	Parameters for |:mkspell|.  This tunes when to start compressing the
 	word tree.  Compression can be slow when there are many words, but
 	it's needed to avoid running out of memory.  The amount of memory used
 	per word depends very much on how similar the words are, that's why
 	this tuning is complicated.
 
 	There are three numbers, separated by commas:
 		{start},{inc},{added}
 
 	For most languages the uncompressed word tree fits in memory.  {start}
 	gives the amount of memory in Kbyte that can be used before any
 	compression is done.  It should be a bit smaller than the amount of
 	memory that is available to Vim.
 
 	When going over the {start} limit the {inc} number specifies the
 	amount of memory in Kbyte that can be allocated before another
 	compression is done.  A low number means compression is done after
 	less words are added, which is slow.  A high number means more memory
 	will be allocated.
 
 	After doing compression, {added} times 1024 words can be added before
 	the {inc} limit is ignored and compression is done when any extra
 	amount of memory is needed.  A low number means there is a smaller
 	chance of hitting the {inc} limit, less memory is used but it's
 	slower.
 
 	The languages for which these numbers are important are Italian and
 	Hungarian.  The default works for when you have about 512 Mbyte.  If
 	you have 1 Gbyte you could use: >
 		:set mkspellmem=900000,3000,800
 <	If you have less than 512 Mbyte |:mkspell| may fail for some
 	languages, no matter what you set `'mkspellmem'`  to.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|.

## ml


```lua
vim.opt.modeline
```

 `'modeline'`  `'ml'` 		boolean	(default: on (off for root))
 			local to buffer
 	If `'modeline'`  is on `'modelines'`  gives the number of lines that is
 	checked for set commands.  If `'modeline'`  is off or `'modelines'`  is zero
 	no lines are checked.  See |modeline|.

## mle


```lua
vim.opt.modelineexpr
```

 `'modelineexpr'`  `'mle'` 	boolean (default: off)
 			global
 	When on allow some options that are an expression to be set in the
 	modeline.  Check the option for whether it is affected by
 	`'modelineexpr'` .  Also see |modeline|.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## mls


```lua
vim.opt.modelines
```

 `'modelines'`  `'mls'` 	number	(default 5)
 			global
 	If `'modeline'`  is on `'modelines'`  gives the number of lines that is
 	checked for set commands.  If `'modeline'`  is off or `'modelines'`  is zero
 	no lines are checked.  See |modeline|.

## mmd


```lua
vim.opt.maxmapdepth
```

 `'maxmapdepth'`  `'mmd'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global
 	Maximum number of times a mapping is done without resulting in a
 	character to be used.  This normally catches endless mappings, like
 	":map x y" with ":map y x".  It still does not catch ":map g wg",
 	because the `'w'`  is used before the next mapping is done.  See also
 	|key-mapping|.

## mmp


```lua
vim.opt.maxmempattern
```

 `'maxmempattern'`  `'mmp'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global
 	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for pattern matching.
 	The maximum value is about 2000000.  Use this to work without a limit.
 
 	When Vim runs into the limit it gives an error message and mostly
 	behaves like CTRL-C was typed.
 	Running into the limit often means that the pattern is very
 	inefficient or too complex.  This may already happen with the pattern
 	"\(.\)*" on a very long line.  ".*" works much better.
 	Might also happen on redraw, when syntax rules try to match a complex
 	text structure.
 	Vim may run out of memory before hitting the `'maxmempattern'`  limit, in
 	which case you get an "Out of memory" error instead.

## mod


```lua
vim.opt.modified
```

 `'modified'`  `'mod'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When on, the buffer is considered to be modified.  This option is set
 	when:
 	1. A change was made to the text since it was last written.  Using the
 	   |undo| command to go back to the original text will reset the
 	   option.  But undoing changes that were made before writing the
 	   buffer will set the option again, since the text is different from
 	   when it was written.
 	2. `'fileformat'`  or `'fileencoding'`  is different from its original
 	   value.  The original value is set when the buffer is read or
 	   written.  A ":set nomodified" command also resets the original
 	   values to the current values and the `'modified'`  option will be
 	   reset.
 	   Similarly for `'eol'`  and `'bomb'` .
 	This option is not set when a change is made to the buffer as the
 	result of a BufNewFile, BufRead/BufReadPost, BufWritePost,
 	FileAppendPost or VimLeave autocommand event.  See |gzip-example| for
 	an explanation.
 	When `'buftype'`  is "nowrite" or "nofile" this option may be set, but
 	will be ignored.
 	Note that the text may actually be the same, e.g. `'modified'`  is set
 	when using "rA" on an "A".

## modeline


```lua
boolean
```

 `'modeline'`  `'ml'` 		boolean	(default: on (off for root))
 			local to buffer
 	If `'modeline'`  is on `'modelines'`  gives the number of lines that is
 	checked for set commands.  If `'modeline'`  is off or `'modelines'`  is zero

 	checked for set commands.  If `'modeline'`  is off or `'modelines'`  is zero
 	no lines are checked.  See |modeline|.

## modifiable


```lua
boolean
```

 `'modifiable'`  `'ma'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			local to buffer
 	When off the buffer contents cannot be changed.  The `'fileformat'`  and
 	`'fileencoding'`  options also can't be changed.
 	Can be reset on startup with the |-M| command line argument.

## modified


```lua
boolean
```

 `'modified'`  `'mod'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When on, the buffer is considered to be modified.  This option is set
 	when:

 	when using "rA" on an "A".

## more


```lua
boolean
```

 `'more'` 			boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	When on, listings pause when the whole screen is filled.  You will get
 	the |more-prompt|.  When this option is off there are no pauses, the
 	listing continues until finished.

## mouse


```lua
string
```

 `'mouse'` 			string	(default "nvi")
 			global
 
 	Enables mouse support. For example, to enable the mouse in Normal mode
 	and Visual mode: >
 		:set mouse=nv
 <
 	To temporarily disable mouse support, hold the shift key while using
 	the mouse.
 
 	Mouse support can be enabled for different modes:
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		c	Command-line mode
 		h	all previous modes when editing a help file
 		a	all previous modes
 		r	for |hit-enter| and |more-prompt| prompt
 
 	Left-click anywhere in a text buffer to place the cursor there.  This
 	works with operators too, e.g. type |d| then left-click to delete text
 	from the current cursor position to the position where you clicked.
 
 	Drag the |status-line| or vertical separator of a window to resize it.
 
 	If enabled for "v" (Visual mode) then double-click selects word-wise,
 	triple-click makes it line-wise, and quadruple-click makes it
 	rectangular block-wise.
 
 	For scrolling with a mouse wheel see |scroll-mouse-wheel|.
 
 	Note: When enabling the mouse in a terminal, copy/paste will use the
 	"* register if possible. See also `'clipboard'` .
 
 	Related options:
 	`'mousefocus'` 	window focus follows mouse pointer
 	`'mousemodel'` 	what mouse button does which action
 	`'mousehide'` 	hide mouse pointer while typing text
 	`'selectmode'` 	whether to start Select mode or Visual mode
 
 	The :behave command provides some "profiles" for mouse behavior.
 
 	:be[have] {model}	Set behavior for mouse and selection.  Valid
 				arguments are:
 				   mswin	MS-Windows behavior
 				   xterm	Xterm behavior
 
 				Using ":behave" changes these options:
 				option		mswin			xterm	~
 				`'selectmode'` 	"mouse,key"		""
 				`'mousemodel'` 	"popup"			"extend"
 				`'keymodel'` 	"startsel,stopsel"	""
 				`'selection'` 	"exclusive"		"inclusive"

## mousef


```lua
vim.opt.mousefocus
```

 `'mousefocus'`  `'mousef'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	The window that the mouse pointer is on is automatically activated.
 	When changing the window layout or window focus in another way, the
 	mouse pointer is moved to the window with keyboard focus.  Off is the
 	default because it makes using the pull down menus a little goofy, as
 	a pointer transit may activate a window unintentionally.

## mousefocus


```lua
boolean
```

 `'mousefocus'`  `'mousef'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	The window that the mouse pointer is on is automatically activated.
 	When changing the window layout or window focus in another way, the
 	mouse pointer is moved to the window with keyboard focus.  Off is the
 	default because it makes using the pull down menus a little goofy, as

## mousehide


```lua
boolean
```

 `'mousehide'`  `'mh'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 			{only works in the GUI}
 	When on, the mouse pointer is hidden when characters are typed.
 	The mouse pointer is restored when the mouse is moved.

## mousem


```lua
vim.opt.mousemodel
```

 `'mousemodel'`  `'mousem'` 	string	(default "popup_setpos")
 			global
 	Sets the model to use for the mouse.  The name mostly specifies what
 	the right mouse button is used for:
 	   extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works
 			like in an xterm.
 	   popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
 			mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
 			with Microsoft Windows.
 	   popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the
 			position where the mouse was clicked, and thus the
 			selected operation will act upon the clicked object.
 			If clicking inside a selection, that selection will
 			be acted upon, i.e. no cursor move.  This implies of
 			course, that right clicking outside a selection will
 			end Visual mode.
 	Overview of what button does what for each model:
 	mouse		    extend		popup(_setpos) ~
 	left click	    place cursor	place cursor
 	left drag	    start selection	start selection
 	shift-left	    search word		extend selection
 	right click	    extend selection	popup menu (place cursor)
 	right drag	    extend selection	-
 	middle click	    paste		paste
 
 	In the "popup" model the right mouse button produces a pop-up menu.
 	Nvim creates a default |popup-menu| but you can redefine it.
 
 	Note that you can further refine the meaning of buttons with mappings.
 	See |mouse-overview|.  But mappings are NOT used for modeless selection.
 
 	Example: >
 	   :map <S-LeftMouse>     <RightMouse>

## mousemev


```lua
vim.opt.mousemoveevent
```

 `'mousemoveevent'`  `'mousemev'`   boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, mouse move events are delivered to the input queue and are
 	available for mapping. The default, off, avoids the mouse movement
 	overhead except when needed.
 	Warning: Setting this option can make pending mappings to be aborted
 	when the mouse is moved.

## mousemodel


```lua
string

 `'mousemoveevent'`  `'mousemev'`   boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, mouse move events are delivered to the input queue and are
 	available for mapping. The default, off, avoids the mouse movement
 	overhead except when needed.
 	Warning: Setting this option can make pending mappings to be aborted

## mouses


```lua
vim.opt.mouseshape
```

 `'mouseshape'`  `'mouses'` 	string	(default "i:beam,r:beam,s:updown,sd:cross,
 					m:no,ml:up-arrow,v:rightup-arrow")
 			global
 	This option tells Vim what the mouse pointer should look like in
 	different modes.  The option is a comma-separated list of parts, much
 	like used for `'guicursor'` .  Each part consist of a mode/location-list
 	and an argument-list:
 		mode-list:shape,mode-list:shape,..
 	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes/locations:
 			In a normal window: ~
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		ve	Visual mode with `'selection'`  "exclusive" (same as `'v'` ,
 			if not specified)
 		o	Operator-pending mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		r	Replace mode
 
 			Others: ~
 		c	appending to the command-line
 		ci	inserting in the command-line
 		cr	replacing in the command-line
 		m	at the 'Hit ENTER' or `'More'`  prompts
 		ml	idem, but cursor in the last line
 		e	any mode, pointer below last window
 		s	any mode, pointer on a status line
 		sd	any mode, while dragging a status line
 		vs	any mode, pointer on a vertical separator line
 		vd	any mode, while dragging a vertical separator line
 		a	everywhere
 
 	The shape is one of the following:
 	avail	name		looks like ~
 	w x	arrow		Normal mouse pointer
 	w x	blank		no pointer at all (use with care!)
 	w x	beam		I-beam
 	w x	updown		up-down sizing arrows
 	w x	leftright	left-right sizing arrows
 	w x	busy		The system's usual busy pointer
 	w x	no		The system's usual "no input" pointer
 	  x	udsizing	indicates up-down resizing
 	  x	lrsizing	indicates left-right resizing
 	  x	crosshair	like a big thin +
 	  x	hand1		black hand
 	  x	hand2		white hand
 	  x	pencil		what you write with
 	  x	question	big ?
 	  x	rightup-arrow	arrow pointing right-up
 	w x	up-arrow	arrow pointing up
 	  x	<number>	any X11 pointer number (see X11/cursorfont.h)
 
 	The "avail" column contains a `'w'`  if the shape is available for Win32,
 	x for X11.
 	Any modes not specified or shapes not available use the normal mouse
 	pointer.
 
 	Example: >
 		:set mouseshape=s:udsizing,m:no
 <	will make the mouse turn to a sizing arrow over the status lines and
 	indicate no input when the hit-enter prompt is displayed (since
 	clicking the mouse has no effect in this state.)

## mousescroll


```lua
string
```

 `'mousescroll'` 		string	(default "ver:3,hor:6")
 			global
 	This option controls the number of lines / columns to scroll by when
 	scrolling with a mouse. The option is a comma separated list of parts.
 	Each part consists of a direction and a count as follows:
 		direction:count,direction:count
 	Direction is one of either "hor" or "ver". "hor" controls horizontal
 	scrolling and "ver" controls vertical scrolling. Count sets the amount
 	to scroll by for the given direction, it should be a non negative
 	integer. Each direction should be set at most once. If a direction
 	is omitted, a default value is used (6 for horizontal scrolling and 3
 	for vertical scrolling). You can disable mouse scrolling by using
 	a count of 0.
 
 	Example: >
 		:set mousescroll=ver:5,hor:2
 <	Will make Nvim scroll 5 lines at a time when scrolling vertically, and
 	scroll 2 columns at a time when scrolling horizontally.

## mouseshape


```lua

 	different modes.  The option is a comma-separated list of parts, much
 	like used for `'guicursor'` .  Each part consist of a mode/location-list
 	and an argument-list:
 		mode-list:shape,mode-list:shape,..
 	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes/locations:
 			In a normal window: ~
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		ve	Visual mode with `'selection'`  "exclusive" (same as `'v'` ,
 			if not specified)
 		o	Operator-pending mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		r	Replace mode
 
 			Others: ~
 		c	appending to the command-line
 		ci	inserting in the command-line
 		cr	replacing in the command-line
 		m	at the 'Hit ENTER' or `'More'`  prompts
 		ml	idem, but cursor in the last line
 		e	any mode, pointer below last window
 		s	any mode, pointer on a status line
 		sd	any mode, while dragging a status line
 		vs	any mode, pointer on a vertical separator line
 		vd	any mode, while dragging a vertical separator line
 		a	everywhere
 
 	The shape is one of the following:
 	avail	name		looks like ~
 	w x	arrow		Normal mouse pointer
 	w x	blank		no pointer at all (use with care!)
 	w x	beam		I-beam
 	w x	updown		up-down sizing arrows
 	w x	leftright	left-right sizing arrows
 	w x	busy		The system's usual busy pointer
 	w x	no		The system's usual "no input" pointer
 	  x	udsizing	indicates up-down resizing
 	  x	lrsizing	indicates left-right resizing
 	  x	crosshair	like a big thin +
 	  x	hand1		black hand
 	  x	hand2		white hand
 	  x	pencil		what you write with
 	  x	question	big ?
 	  x	rightup-arrow	arrow pointing right-up
 	w x	up-arrow	arrow pointing up
 	  x	<number>	any X11 pointer number (see X11/cursorfont.h)
 
 	The "avail" column contains a `'w'`  if the shape is available for Win32,
 	x for X11.
 	Any modes not specified or shapes not available use the normal mouse
 	pointer.
 
 	Example: >
 		:set mouseshape=s:udsizing,m:no
 <	will make the mouse turn to a sizing arrow over the status lines and
 	indicate no input when the hit-enter prompt is displayed (since
 	clicking the mouse has no effect in this state.)

## mouset


```lua
vim.opt.mousetime
```

 `'mousetime'`  `'mouset'` 	number	(default 500)
 			global
 	Defines the maximum time in msec between two mouse clicks for the
 	second click to be recognized as a multi click.

## mousetime


```lua
integer
```

 `'mousetime'`  `'mouset'` 	number	(default 500)
 			global
 	Defines the maximum time in msec between two mouse clicks for the
 	second click to be recognized as a multi click.

## mp


```lua
vim.opt.makeprg
```

 `'makeprg'`  `'mp'` 		string	(default "make")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Program to use for the ":make" command.  See |:make_makeprg|.
 	This option may contain `'%'`  and `'#'`  characters (see  |:_%| and |:_#|),
 	which are expanded to the current and alternate file name.  Use |::S|
 	to escape file names in case they contain special characters.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
 	about including spaces and backslashes.
 	Note that a `'|'`  must be escaped twice: once for ":set" and once for
 	the interpretation of a command.  When you use a filter called
 	"myfilter" do it like this: >
 	    :set makeprg=gmake\ \\\|\ myfilter
 <	The placeholder "$*" can be given (even multiple times) to specify
 	where the arguments will be included, for example: >
 	    :set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## mps


```lua
vim.opt.matchpairs
```

 `'matchpairs'`  `'mps'` 	string	(default "(:),{:},[:]")
 			local to buffer
 	Characters that form pairs.  The |%| command jumps from one to the
 	other.
 	Only character pairs are allowed that are different, thus you cannot
 	jump between two double quotes.
 	The characters must be separated by a colon.
 	The pairs must be separated by a comma.  Example for including `'<'`  and
 	`'>'`  (for HTML): >
 		:set mps+=<:>
 
 <	A more exotic example, to jump between the `'='`  and `';'`  in an
 	assignment, useful for languages like C and Java: >
 		:au FileType c,cpp,java set mps+==:;
 
 <	For a more advanced way of using "%", see the matchit.vim plugin in
 	the $VIMRUNTIME/plugin directory. |add-local-help|

## msm


```lua
vim.opt.mkspellmem
```

 `'mkspellmem'`  `'msm'` 	string	(default "460000,2000,500")
 			global
 	Parameters for |:mkspell|.  This tunes when to start compressing the
 	word tree.  Compression can be slow when there are many words, but
 	it's needed to avoid running out of memory.  The amount of memory used
 	per word depends very much on how similar the words are, that's why
 	this tuning is complicated.
 
 	There are three numbers, separated by commas:
 		{start},{inc},{added}
 
 	For most languages the uncompressed word tree fits in memory.  {start}
 	gives the amount of memory in Kbyte that can be used before any
 	compression is done.  It should be a bit smaller than the amount of
 	memory that is available to Vim.
 
 	When going over the {start} limit the {inc} number specifies the
 	amount of memory in Kbyte that can be allocated before another
 	compression is done.  A low number means compression is done after
 	less words are added, which is slow.  A high number means more memory
 	will be allocated.
 
 	After doing compression, {added} times 1024 words can be added before
 	the {inc} limit is ignored and compression is done when any extra
 	amount of memory is needed.  A low number means there is a smaller
 	chance of hitting the {inc} limit, less memory is used but it's
 	slower.
 
 	The languages for which these numbers are important are Italian and
 	Hungarian.  The default works for when you have about 512 Mbyte.  If
 	you have 1 Gbyte you could use: >
 		:set mkspellmem=900000,3000,800
 <	If you have less than 512 Mbyte |:mkspell| may fail for some
 	languages, no matter what you set `'mkspellmem'`  to.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|.

## nf


```lua
vim.opt.nrformats
```

 `'nrformats'`  `'nf'` 	string	(default "bin,hex")
 			local to buffer
 	This defines what bases Vim will consider for numbers when using the
 	CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands for adding to and subtracting from a number
 	respectively; see |CTRL-A| for more info on these commands.
 	alpha	If included, single alphabetical characters will be
 		incremented or decremented.  This is useful for a list with a
 		letter index a), b), etc.
 	octal	If included, numbers that start with a zero will be considered
 		to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in "010".
 	hex	If included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
 		considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
 		"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
 	bin	If included, numbers starting with "0b" or "0B" will be
 		considered to be binary.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
 		"0b1000" subtracts one, resulting in "0b0111".
 	unsigned    If included, numbers are recognized as unsigned. Thus a
 		leading dash or negative sign won't be considered as part of
 		the number.  Examples:
 		    Using CTRL-X on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2019"
 		    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2021").
 		    Using CTRL-A on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2021"
 		    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2019").
 		    Using CTRL-X on "0" or CTRL-A on "18446744073709551615"
 		    (2^64 - 1) has no effect, overflow is prevented.
 	Numbers which simply begin with a digit in the range 1-9 are always
 	considered decimal.  This also happens for numbers that are not
 	recognized as octal or hex.

## nu


```lua
vim.opt.number

 `'number'`  `'nu'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Print the line number in front of each line.  When the `'n'`  option is

## numberwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'numberwidth'`  `'nuw'` 	number	(default: 4)
 			local to window
 	Minimal number of columns to use for the line number.  Only relevant
 	when the `'number'`  or `'relativenumber'`  option is set or printing lines
 	with a line number. Since one space is always between the number and
 	the text, there is one less character for the number itself.
 	The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to
 	fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of
 	rows in the window, depending on whether `'number'`  or `'relativenumber'` 
 	is set. Thus with the Vim default of 4 there is room for a line number
 	up to 999. When the buffer has 1000 lines five columns will be used.
 	The minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 20.

vim.opt.path
```

 `'path'`  `'pa'` 		string	(default on Unix: ".,/usr/include,,"

 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
 	|gf|, [f, ]f, ^Wf, |:find|, |:sfind|, |:tabfind| and other commands,
 	provided that the file being searched for has a relative path (not
 	starting with "/", "./" or "../").  The directories in the `'path'` 
 	option may be relative or absolute.
 	- Use commas to separate directory names: >
 		:set path=.,/usr/local/include,/usr/include
 <	- Spaces can also be used to separate directory names (for backwards
 	  compatibility with version 3.0).  To have a space in a directory
 	  name, precede it with an extra backslash, and escape the space: >
 		:set path=.,/dir/with\\\ space
 <	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with an extra
 	  backslash: >
 		:set path=.,/dir/with\\,comma
 <	- To search relative to the directory of the current file, use: >
 		:set path=.
 <	- To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
 	  commas: >
 		:set path=,,
 <	- A directory name may end in a `':'`  or `'/'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- When using |netrw.vim| URLs can be used.  For example, adding
 	  "https://www.vim.org" will make ":find index.html" work.
 	- Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "" and
 	  ";".  See |file-searching| for info and syntax.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type two to get one in the option: >
 		:set path=.,c:\\include
 <	  Or just use `'/'`  instead: >
 		:set path=.,c:/include
 <	Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
 	the file!
 	The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
 	it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
 	You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
 	`'path'` , see |:checkpath|.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.  To remove the current directory use: >
 		:set path-=
 <	To add the current directory use: >
 		:set path+=
 <	To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the
 	separator.  Here is an example to append $INCL, in which directory
 	names are separated with a semi-colon: >
 		:let &path = &path .. "," .. substitute($INCL, `';'` , `','` , `'g'` )
 <	Replace the `';'`  with a `':'`  or whatever separator is used.  Note that
 	this doesn't work when $INCL contains a comma or white space.

## packpath

 `'patchexpr'`  `'pex'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	Expression which is evaluated to apply a patch to a file and generate
 	the resulting new version of the file.  See |diff-patchexpr|.

## patchmode


```lua
string
```

 `'patchmode'`  `'pm'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	When non-empty the oldest version of a file is kept.  This can be used
 	to keep the original version of a file if you are changing files in a
 	source distribution.  Only the first time that a file is written a
 	copy of the original file will be kept.  The name of the copy is the
 	name of the original file with the string in the `'patchmode'`  option
 	appended.  This option should start with a dot.  Use a string like
 	".orig" or ".org".  `'backupdir'`  must not be empty for this to work
 	(Detail: The backup file is renamed to the patchmode file after the
 	new file has been successfully written, that's why it must be possible
 	to write a backup file).  If there was no file to be backed up, an
 	empty file is created.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a patchmode file is not made.
 	Using `'patchmode'`  for compressed files appends the extension at the
 	end (e.g., "file.gz.orig"), thus the resulting name isn't always
 	recognized as a compressed file.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

 	uses another default.  To remove the current directory use: >
 		:set path-=
 <	To add the current directory use: >
 		:set path+=
 <	To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the
 	separator.  Here is an example to append $INCL, in which directory
 	names are separated with a semi-colon: >
 		:let &path = &path .. "," .. substitute($INCL, `';'` , `','` , `'g'` )
 <	Replace the `';'`  with a `':'`  or whatever separator is used.  Note that
 	this doesn't work when $INCL contains a comma or white space.

## pb


```lua
vim.opt.pumblend
```

 `'pumblend'`  `'pb'` 		number	(default 0)
 			global
 	Enables pseudo-transparency for the |popup-menu|. Valid values are in
 	the range of 0 for fully opaque popupmenu (disabled) to 100 for fully
 	transparent background. Values between 0-30 are typically most useful.
 
 	It is possible to override the level for individual highlights within
 	the popupmenu using |highlight-blend|. For instance, to enable
 	transparency but force the current selected element to be fully opaque: >
 
 		:set pumblend=15
 		:hi PmenuSel blend=0
 <
 	UI-dependent. Works best with RGB colors. `'termguicolors'` 

## pex


```lua
vim.opt.patchexpr
```

 `'patchexpr'`  `'pex'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	Expression which is evaluated to apply a patch to a file and generate
 	the resulting new version of the file.  See |diff-patchexpr|.

## ph


```lua
vim.opt.pumheight
```

 `'pumheight'`  `'ph'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 	Maximum number of items to show in the popup menu
 	(|ins-completion-menu|). Zero means "use available screen space".

## pi


```lua
vim.opt.preserveindent
```

 `'preserveindent'`  `'pi'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When changing the indent of the current line, preserve as much of the
 	indent structure as possible.  Normally the indent is replaced by a
 	series of tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |`'expandtab'` | is
 	enabled, in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option
 	means the indent will preserve as many existing characters as possible
 	for indenting, and only add additional tabs or spaces as required.
 	`'expandtab'`  does not apply to the preserved white space, a Tab remains
 	a Tab.
 	NOTE: When using ">>" multiple times the resulting indent is a mix of
 	tabs and spaces.  You might not like this.
 	Also see `'copyindent'` .
 	Use |:retab| to clean up white space.

## pm


```lua
vim.opt.patchmode
```

 `'patchmode'`  `'pm'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	When non-empty the oldest version of a file is kept.  This can be used
 	to keep the original version of a file if you are changing files in a
 	source distribution.  Only the first time that a file is written a
 	copy of the original file will be kept.  The name of the copy is the
 	name of the original file with the string in the `'patchmode'`  option
 	appended.  This option should start with a dot.  Use a string like
 	".orig" or ".org".  `'backupdir'`  must not be empty for this to work
 	(Detail: The backup file is renamed to the patchmode file after the
 	new file has been successfully written, that's why it must be possible
 	to write a backup file).  If there was no file to be backed up, an
 	empty file is created.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a patchmode file is not made.
 	Using `'patchmode'`  for compressed files appends the extension at the
 	end (e.g., "file.gz.orig"), thus the resulting name isn't always
 	recognized as a compressed file.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

## pp


```lua
vim.opt.packpath
```

 `'packpath'`  `'pp'` 		string	(default: see `'runtimepath'` )
 	Directories used to find packages.  See |packages| and |rtp-packages|.

 	commands.  Used for |CTRL-W_}| when no count is given.

## previewwindow


```lua
boolean
```

 `'previewwindow'`  `'pvw'` 	boolean (default off)
 			local to window
 	Identifies the preview window.  Only one window can have this option

 	(|ins-completion-menu|). Zero means "use available screen space".

## pumwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'pumwidth'`  `'pw'` 		number	(default 15)
 			global
 	Minimum width for the popup menu (|ins-completion-menu|).  If the
 	cursor column + `'pumwidth'`  exceeds screen width, the popup menu is
 	nudged to fit on the screen.

## pvh


```lua
vim.opt.previewheight
```

 `'previewheight'`  `'pvh'` 	number (default 12)
 			global

 	nudged to fit on the screen.

## pyx


```lua
vim.opt.pyxversion
```

 `'pyxversion'`  `'pyx'` 	number	(default 3)
 			global
 	Specifies the python version used for pyx* functions and commands
 	|python_x|.  As only Python 3 is supported, this always has the value
 	`3`. Setting any other value is an error.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## pyxversion


```lua
integer

## qe


```lua
vim.opt.quoteescape
```

 `'quoteescape'`  `'qe'` 	string	(default "\")
 			local to buffer
 	The characters that are used to escape quotes in a string.  Used for
 	objects like a', a" and a` |a'|.
 	When one of the characters in this option is found inside a string,
 	the following character will be skipped.  The default value makes the
 	text "foo\"bar\\" considered to be one string.

## qftf


```lua
vim.opt.quickfixtextfunc
```

 `'quickfixtextfunc'`  `'qftf'` 	string (default "")
 			global
 	This option specifies a function to be used to get the text to display
 	in the quickfix and location list windows.  This can be used to
 	customize the information displayed in the quickfix or location window
 	for each entry in the corresponding quickfix or location list.  See
 	|quickfix-window-function| for an explanation of how to write the
 	function and an example.  The value can be the name of a function, a
 	|lambda| or a |Funcref|. See |option-value-function| for more
 	information.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## quickfixtextfunc

## rdb


```lua
vim.opt.redrawdebug
```

 `'redrawdebug'`  `'rdb'` 	string	(default `''` )
 			global
 	Flags to change the way redrawing works, for debugging purposes.
 	Most useful with `'writedelay'`  set to some reasonable value.
 	Supports the following flags:
 	    compositor	Indicate each redraw event handled by the compositor
 			by briefly flashing the redrawn regions in colors
 			indicating the redraw type. These are the highlight
 			groups used (and their default colors):
 		RedrawDebugNormal   gui=reverse   normal redraw passed through
 		RedrawDebugClear    guibg=Yellow  clear event passed through
 		RedrawDebugComposed guibg=Green   redraw event modified by the
 						  compositor (due to
 						  overlapping grids, etc)
 		RedrawDebugRecompose guibg=Red    redraw generated by the
 						  compositor itself, due to a
 						  grid being moved or deleted.
 	    line	introduce a delay after each line drawn on the screen.
 			When using the TUI or another single-grid UI, "compositor"
 			gives more information and should be preferred (every
 			line is processed as a separate event by the compositor)
 	    flush	introduce a delay after each "flush" event.
 	    nothrottle	Turn off throttling of the message grid. This is an
 			optimization that joins many small scrolls to one
 			larger scroll when drawing the message area (with
 			`'display'`  msgsep flag active).
 	    invalid	Enable stricter checking (abort) of inconsistencies
 			of the internal screen state. This is mostly
 			useful when running nvim inside a debugger (and
 			the test suite).
 	    nodelta	Send all internally redrawn cells to the UI, even if
 			they are unchanged from the already displayed state.

## rdt


```lua
vim.opt.redrawtime
```

 `'redrawtime'`  `'rdt'` 	number	(default 2000)
 			global
 	Time in milliseconds for redrawing the display.  Applies to
 	`'hlsearch'` , `'inccommand'` , |:match| highlighting and syntax
 	highlighting.
 	When redrawing takes more than this many milliseconds no further
 	matches will be highlighted.
 	For syntax highlighting the time applies per window.  When over the
 	limit syntax highlighting is disabled until |CTRL-L| is used.
 	This is used to avoid that Vim hangs when using a very complicated
 	pattern.

## re


```lua
vim.opt.regexpengine
```

 `'regexpengine'`  `'re'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 	This selects the default regexp engine. |two-engines|
 	The possible values are:
 		0	automatic selection
 		1	old engine
 		2	NFA engine
 	Note that when using the NFA engine and the pattern contains something
 	that is not supported the pattern will not match.  This is only useful
 	for debugging the regexp engine.
 	Using automatic selection enables Vim to switch the engine, if the
 	default engine becomes too costly.  E.g., when the NFA engine uses too
 	many states.  This should prevent Vim from hanging on a combination of
 	a complex pattern with long text.

## readonly


```lua
boolean
```

 `'readonly'`  `'ro'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	If on, writes fail unless you use a `'!'` .  Protects you from
 	accidentally overwriting a file.  Default on when Vim is started
 	in read-only mode ("vim -R") or when the executable is called "view".
 	When using ":w!" the `'readonly'`  option is reset for the current
 	buffer, unless the `'Z'`  flag is in `'cpoptions'` .
 	When using the ":view" command the `'readonly'`  option is set for the
 	newly edited buffer.
 	See `'modifiable'`  for disallowing changes to the buffer.

## redrawdebug


```lua

## relativenumber


```lua
boolean
```

 `'relativenumber'`  `'rnu'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of
 	each line. Relative line numbers help you use the |count| you can
 	precede some vertical motion commands (e.g. j k + -) with, without
 	having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
 	other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
 	When the `'n'`  option is excluded from `'cpoptions'`  a wrapped
 	line will not use the column of line numbers.
 	The `'numberwidth'`  option can be used to set the room used for the line
 	number.
 	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, `'-'` 
 	characters are put before the number.
 	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
 	the number.
 
 	The number in front of the cursor line also depends on the value of
 	`'number'` , see |number_relativenumber| for all combinations of the two
 	options.

## remap


```lua
boolean
```

## report


```lua
integer
```

 `'report'` 		number	(default 2)
 			global
 	Threshold for reporting number of lines changed.  When the number of
 	changed lines is more than `'report'`  a message will be given for most
 	":" commands.  If you want it always, set `'report'`  to 0.
 	For the ":substitute" command the number of substitutions is used
 	instead of the number of lines.

## revins


```lua
boolean
```

 `'revins'`  `'ri'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Inserting characters in Insert mode will work backwards.  See "typing
 	backwards" |ins-reverse|.  This option can be toggled with the CTRL-_
 	command in Insert mode, when `'allowrevins'`  is set.

## ri


```lua
vim.opt.revins
```

 `'revins'`  `'ri'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Inserting characters in Insert mode will work backwards.  See "typing
 	backwards" |ins-reverse|.  This option can be toggled with the CTRL-_
 	command in Insert mode, when `'allowrevins'`  is set.

## rightleft


```lua
boolean
```

 `'rightleft'`  `'rl'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	When on, display orientation becomes right-to-left, i.e., characters
 	that are stored in the file appear from the right to the left.
 	Using this option, it is possible to edit files for languages that
 	are written from the right to the left such as Hebrew and Arabic.
 	This option is per window, so it is possible to edit mixed files
 	simultaneously, or to view the same file in both ways (this is
 	useful whenever you have a mixed text file with both right-to-left
 	and left-to-right strings so that both sets are displayed properly
 	in different windows).  Also see |rileft.txt|.

## rightleftcmd


```lua
string
```

 `'rightleftcmd'`  `'rlc'` 	string	(default "search")
 			local to window
 	Each word in this option enables the command line editing to work in
 	right-to-left mode for a group of commands:
 
 		search		"/" and "?" commands
 
 	This is useful for languages such as Hebrew, Arabic and Farsi.
 	The `'rightleft'`  option must be set for `'rightleftcmd'`  to take effect.

## rl

 	5. Session state directory, for state data such as swap, backupdir,
 	   viewdir, undodir, etc.
 	   Given by `stdpath("state")`.  |$XDG_STATE_HOME|
 	6. $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Nvim.
 
 	7, 8, 9, 10. In after/ subdirectories of 1, 2, 3 and 4, with reverse
 	   ordering.  This is for preferences to overrule or add to the
 	   distributed defaults or system-wide settings (rarely needed).
 
 
 	"start" packages will also be searched (|runtime-search-path|) for
 	runtime files after these, though such packages are not explicitly
 	reported in &runtimepath. But "opt" packages are explicitly added to
 	&runtimepath by |:packadd|.
 
 	Note that, unlike `'path'` , no wildcards like "" are allowed.  Normal
 	wildcards are allowed, but can significantly slow down searching for
 	runtime files.  For speed, use as few items as possible and avoid
 	wildcards.
 	See |:runtime|.
 	Example: >
 		:set runtimepath=~/vimruntime,/mygroup/vim,$VIMRUNTIME
 <	This will use the directory "~/vimruntime" first (containing your
 	personal Nvim runtime files), then "/mygroup/vim", and finally
 	"$VIMRUNTIME" (the default runtime files).
 	You can put a directory before $VIMRUNTIME to find files which replace
 	distributed runtime files.  You can put a directory after $VIMRUNTIME
 	to find files which add to distributed runtime files.
 
 	With |--clean| the home directory entries are not included.

## ru


```lua
vim.opt.ruler
```

 `'ruler'`  `'ru'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Show the line and column number of the cursor position, separated by a
 	comma.  When there is room, the relative position of the displayed
 	text in the file is shown on the far right:
 		Top	first line is visible
 		Bot	last line is visible
 		All	first and last line are visible
 		45%	relative position in the file
 	If `'rulerformat'`  is set, it will determine the contents of the ruler.
 	Each window has its own ruler.  If a window has a status line, the
 	ruler is shown there.  If a window doesn't have a status line and
 	`'cmdheight'`  is zero, the ruler is not shown.  Otherwise it is shown in
 	the last line of the screen.  If the statusline is given by
 	`'statusline'`  (i.e. not empty), this option takes precedence over
 	`'ruler'`  and `'rulerformat'` .
 	If the number of characters displayed is different from the number of
 	bytes in the text (e.g., for a TAB or a multibyte character), both
 	the text column (byte number) and the screen column are shown,
 	separated with a dash.
 	For an empty line "0-1" is shown.
 	For an empty buffer the line number will also be zero: "0,0-1".
 	If you don't want to see the ruler all the time but want to know where
 	you are, use "g CTRL-G" |g_CTRL-G|.

## ruf

## sb


```lua
vim.opt.splitbelow
```

 `'splitbelow'`  `'sb'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, splitting a window will put the new window below the current
 	one. |:split|

## sbo


```lua
vim.opt.scrollopt
```

 `'scrollopt'`  `'sbo'` 	string	(default "ver,jump")
 			global
 	This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
 	`'scrollbind'`  windows should behave.  `'sbo'`  stands for ScrollBind
 	Options.
 	The following words are available:
 	    ver		Bind vertical scrolling for `'scrollbind'`  windows
 	    hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for `'scrollbind'`  windows
 	    jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
 			scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
 			displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
 			around in a window, another `'scrollbind'`  window may
 			reach a position before the start or after the end of
 			the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
 			moving back the `'scrollbind'`  window will try to scroll
 			to the desired position when possible.
 			When now making that window the current one, two
 			things can be done with the relative offset:
 			1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
 			   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
 			   window.  When going back to the other window, the
 			   new relative offset will be used.
 			2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
 			   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
 			   going back to the other window, it still uses the
 			   same relative offset.
 	Also see |scroll-binding|.
 	When `'diff'`  mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
 	even when "ver" isn't there.

## sbr


```lua
vim.opt.showbreak
```

 `'showbreak'`  `'sbr'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	String to put at the start of lines that have been wrapped.  Useful
 	values are "> " or "+++ ": >
 		:set showbreak=>\
 <	Note the backslash to escape the trailing space.  It's easier like
 	this: >
 		:let &showbreak = '+++ '
 <	Only printable single-cell characters are allowed, excluding <Tab> and
 	comma (in a future version the comma might be used to separate the
 	part that is shown at the end and at the start of a line).
 	The |hl-NonText| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	Note that tabs after the showbreak will be displayed differently.
 	If you want the `'showbreak'`  to appear in between line numbers, add the
 	"n" flag to `'cpoptions'` .
 	A window-local value overrules a global value.  If the global value is
 	set and you want no value in the current window use NONE: >
 		:setlocal showbreak=NONE
 <

## sc


```lua
vim.opt.showcmd
```

 `'showcmd'`  `'sc'` 		boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	Show (partial) command in the last line of the screen.  Set this
 	option off if your terminal is slow.
 	In Visual mode the size of the selected area is shown:
 	- When selecting characters within a line, the number of characters.
 	  If the number of bytes is different it is also displayed: "2-6"
 	  means two characters and six bytes.
 	- When selecting more than one line, the number of lines.
 	- When selecting a block, the size in screen characters:
 	  {lines}x{columns}.
 	This information can be displayed in an alternative location using the
 	`'showcmdloc'`  option, useful when `'cmdheight'`  is 0.

## scb


```lua
vim.opt.scrollbind
```

 `'scrollbind'`  `'scb'` 	boolean  (default off)
 			local to window
 	See also |scroll-binding|.  When this option is set, the current
 	window scrolls as other scrollbind windows (windows that also have
 	this option set) scroll.  This option is useful for viewing the
 	differences between two versions of a file, see `'diff'` .
 	See |`'scrollopt'` | for options that determine how this option should be
 	interpreted.
 	This option is mostly reset when splitting a window to edit another
 	file.  This means that ":split | edit file" results in two windows
 	with scroll-binding, but ":split file" does not.

## scbk


```lua
vim.opt.scrollback
```

 `'scrollback'`  `'scbk'` 	number	(default: 10000)
 			local to buffer
 	Maximum number of lines kept beyond the visible screen. Lines at the
 	top are deleted if new lines exceed this limit.
 	Minimum is 1, maximum is 100000.
 	Only in |terminal| buffers.

## scl


```lua
vim.opt.signcolumn
```

 `'signcolumn'`  `'scl'` 	string	(default "auto")
 			local to window
 	When and how to draw the signcolumn. Valid values are:
 	   "auto"	only when there is a sign to display
 	   "auto:[1-9]" resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
 	                given number (maximum 9), e.g. "auto:4"
 	   "auto:[1-8]-[2-9]"
 	                resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
 			given maximum number (maximum 9) while keeping
 			at least the given minimum (maximum 8) fixed
 			space. The minimum number should always be less
 			than the maximum number, e.g. "auto:2-5"
 	   "no"		never
 	   "yes"	always
 	   "yes:[1-9]"  always, with fixed space for signs up to the given
 	                number (maximum 9), e.g. "yes:3"
 	   "number"	display signs in the `'number'`  column. If the number
 			column is not present, then behaves like "auto".
 
 	Note regarding "orphaned signs": with signcolumn numbers higher than
 	1, deleting lines will also remove the associated signs automatically,
 	in contrast to the default Vim behavior of keeping and grouping them.
 	This is done in order for the signcolumn appearance not appear weird
 	during line deletion.

## scr


```lua
vim.opt.scroll
```

 `'scroll'`  `'scr'` 		number	(default: half the window height)
 			local to window
 	Number of lines to scroll with CTRL-U and CTRL-D commands.  Will be
 	set to half the number of lines in the window when the window size
 	changes.  This may happen when enabling the |status-line| or
 	`'tabline'`  option after setting the `'scroll'`  option.
 	If you give a count to the CTRL-U or CTRL-D command it will
 	be used as the new value for `'scroll'` .  Reset to half the window
 	height with ":set scroll=0".

## scroll


```lua
integer
```

 `'scroll'`  `'scr'` 		number	(default: half the window height)
 			local to window
 	Number of lines to scroll with CTRL-U and CTRL-D commands.  Will be
 	set to half the number of lines in the window when the window size
 	changes.  This may happen when enabling the |status-line| or
 	`'tabline'`  option after setting the `'scroll'`  option.
 	If you give a count to the CTRL-U or CTRL-D command it will
 	be used as the new value for `'scroll'` .  Reset to half the window
 	height with ":set scroll=0".

## scrollback


```lua
integer
```

 `'scrollback'`  `'scbk'` 	number	(default: 10000)
 			local to buffer
 	Maximum number of lines kept beyond the visible screen. Lines at the
 	top are deleted if new lines exceed this limit.
 	Minimum is 1, maximum is 100000.
 	Only in |terminal| buffers.

## scrollbind


```lua
boolean
```

 `'scrollbind'`  `'scb'` 	boolean  (default off)
 			local to window
 	See also |scroll-binding|.  When this option is set, the current
 	window scrolls as other scrollbind windows (windows that also have
 	this option set) scroll.  This option is useful for viewing the
 	differences between two versions of a file, see `'diff'` .
 	See |`'scrollopt'` | for options that determine how this option should be
 	interpreted.
 	This option is mostly reset when splitting a window to edit another
 	file.  This means that ":split | edit file" results in two windows
 	with scroll-binding, but ":split file" does not.

## scrolljump


```lua
integer
```

 `'scrolljump'`  `'sj'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	Minimal number of lines to scroll when the cursor gets off the
 	screen (e.g., with "j").  Not used for scroll commands (e.g., CTRL-E,
 	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.
 	When set to a negative number from -1 to -100 this is used as the
 	percentage of the window height.  Thus -50 scrolls half the window
 	height.

## scrolloff


```lua
integer
```

 `'scrolloff'`  `'so'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
 	This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
 	you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
 	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
 	when long lines wrap).
 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
 	these two: >
 		setlocal scrolloff<
 		setlocal scrolloff=-1
 <	For scrolling horizontally see `'sidescrolloff'` .

## scrollopt


```lua
string
```

 `'scrollopt'`  `'sbo'` 	string	(default "ver,jump")
 			global
 	This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
 	`'scrollbind'`  windows should behave.  `'sbo'`  stands for ScrollBind
 	Options.
 	The following words are available:
 	    ver		Bind vertical scrolling for `'scrollbind'`  windows
 	    hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for `'scrollbind'`  windows
 	    jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
 			scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
 			displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
 			around in a window, another `'scrollbind'`  window may
 			reach a position before the start or after the end of

 	Also see |scroll-binding|.
 	When `'diff'`  mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
 	even when "ver" isn't there.

## scs


```lua
vim.opt.smartcase
```

 `'smartcase'`  `'scs'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Override the `'ignorecase'`  option if the search pattern contains upper
 	case characters.  Only used when the search pattern is typed and
 	`'ignorecase'`  option is on.  Used for the commands "/", "?", "n", "N",
 	":g" and ":s".  Not used for "*", "#", "gd", tag search, etc.  After
 	"*" and "#" you can make `'smartcase'`  used by doing a "/" command,
 	recalling the search pattern from history and hitting <Enter>.

## sd


```lua
vim.opt.shada
```

 `'shada'`  `'sd'` 		string	(default for
 				   Win32:  !,'100,<50,s10,h,rA:,rB:
 				   others: !,'100,<50,s10,h)
 			global
 	When non-empty, the shada file is read upon startup and written
 	when exiting Vim (see |shada-file|).  The string should be a comma-
 	separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
 	identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
 	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
 	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
 	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
 	the effect of their value.
 	CHAR	VALUE	~
 
 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
 
 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
 		the `'<'`  item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
 		start of a comment!
 
 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
 		(`'buftype'` ), unlisted (`'buflisted'` ), unnamed and buffers on
 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
 		buffers are stored.
 
 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
 		`'shada'`  is non-empty.
 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
 
 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
 		`'history'`  is used.
 
 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
 		saved.  When not included, the value of `'history'`  is used.
 
 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
 		saved.  `'"'`  is the old name for this item.
 		Also see the `'s'`  item below: limit specified in KiB.
 
 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
 		saved.  When not included, the value of `'history'`  is used.
 
 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and `'encoding'`  value is fixed
 		to UTF-8 as well.
 
 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
 
 	h	Disable the effect of `'hlsearch'`  when loading the shada
 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
 		has been used since the last search command.
 
 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
 		the `'n'` .  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
 		`'shadafile'`  option is set, that file name overrides the one
 		given here with `'shada'` .  Environment variables are
 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
 
 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
 		`','` ).  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
 
 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.

 	'50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
 			edited.
 	<1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
 			remembered.
 	s100		Items with contents occupying more then 100 KiB are
 			skipped.
 	:0		Command-line history will not be saved.
 	n~/nvim/shada	The name of the file to use is "~/nvim/shada".
 	no /		Since `'/'`  is not specified, the default will be used,
 			that is, save all of the search history, and also the
 			previous search and substitute patterns.
 	no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
 	no h		`'hlsearch'`  highlighting will be restored.
 
 	When setting `'shada'`  from an empty value you can use |:rshada| to
 	load the contents of the file, this is not done automatically.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## sdf


```lua
vim.opt.shadafile
```

 `'shadafile'`  `'sdf'` 	string	(default: "")
 			global
 	When non-empty, overrides the file name used for |shada| (viminfo).
 	When equal to "NONE" no shada file will be read or written.
 	This option can be set with the |-i| command line flag.  The |--clean|
 	command line flag sets it to "NONE".
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## sect


```lua
vim.opt.sections
```

 `'sections'`  `'sect'` 	string	(default "SHNHH HUnhsh")
 			global
 	Specifies the nroff macros that separate sections.  These are pairs of
 	two letters (See |object-motions|).  The default makes a section start
 	at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

## sections


```lua
string
```

 `'sections'`  `'sect'` 	string	(default "SHNHH HUnhsh")
 			global
 	Specifies the nroff macros that separate sections.  These are pairs of
 	two letters (See |object-motions|).  The default makes a section start
 	at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

## secure


```lua
boolean
```

## sel


```lua
vim.opt.selection
```

 `'selection'`  `'sel'` 	string	(default "inclusive")
 			global
 	This option defines the behavior of the selection.  It is only used
 	in Visual and Select mode.
 	Possible values:
 	   value	past line     inclusive ~
 	   old		   no		yes
 	   inclusive	   yes		yes
 	   exclusive	   yes		no
 	"past line" means that the cursor is allowed to be positioned one
 	character past the line.
 	"inclusive" means that the last character of the selection is included
 	in an operation.  For example, when "x" is used to delete the
 	selection.
 	When "old" is used and `'virtualedit'`  allows the cursor to move past
 	the end of line the line break still isn't included.
 	Note that when "exclusive" is used and selecting from the end
 	backwards, you cannot include the last character of a line, when
 	starting in Normal mode and `'virtualedit'`  empty.
 
 	The `'selection'`  option is set by the |:behave| command.

## selection


```lua
string
```

 `'selection'`  `'sel'` 	string	(default "inclusive")
 			global
 	This option defines the behavior of the selection.  It is only used
 	in Visual and Select mode.
 	Possible values:
 	   value	past line     inclusive ~

 	The `'selection'`  option is set by the |:behave| command.

## selectmode


```lua
string
```

 `'selectmode'`  `'slm'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This is a comma-separated list of words, which specifies when to start
 	Select mode instead of Visual mode, when a selection is started.
 	Possible values:
 	   mouse	when using the mouse
 	   key		when using shifted special keys
 	   cmd		when using "v", "V" or CTRL-V
 	See |Select-mode|.
 	The `'selectmode'`  option is set by the |:behave| command.

## sessionoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'sessionoptions'`  `'ssop'` 	string	(default: "blank,buffers,curdir,folds,
 					       help,tabpages,winsize,terminal")
 			global
 	Changes the effect of the |:mksession| command.  It is a comma-
 	separated list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring
 	something:
 	   word		save and restore ~
 	   blank	empty windows
 	   buffers	hidden and unloaded buffers, not just those in windows
 	   curdir	the current directory
 	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
 			fold options
 	   globals	global variables that start with an uppercase letter
 			and contain at least one lowercase letter.  Only
 			String and Number types are stored.
 	   help		the help window
 	   localoptions	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
 			global values for local options)
 	   options	all options and mappings (also global values for local
 			options)
 	   skiprtp	exclude `'runtimepath'`  and `'packpath'`  from the options
 	   resize	size of the Vim window: `'lines'`  and `'columns'` 
 	   sesdir	the directory in which the session file is located
 			will become the current directory (useful with
 			projects accessed over a network from different
 			systems)
 	   tabpages	all tab pages; without this only the current tab page
 			is restored, so that you can make a session for each
 			tab page separately
 	   terminal	include terminal windows where the command can be
 			restored
 	   winpos	position of the whole Vim window
 	   winsize	window sizes
 	   slash	|deprecated| Always enabled. Uses "/" in filenames.
 	   unix		|deprecated| Always enabled. Uses "\n" line endings.
 
 	Don't include both "curdir" and "sesdir". When neither is included
 	filenames are stored as absolute paths.
 	If you leave out "options" many things won't work well after restoring
 	the session.

## sft


```lua
vim.opt.showfulltag
```

 `'showfulltag'`  `'sft'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When completing a word in insert mode (see |ins-completion|) from the
 	tags file, show both the tag name and a tidied-up form of the search
 	pattern (if there is one) as possible matches.  Thus, if you have
 	matched a C function, you can see a template for what arguments are
 	required (coding style permitting).
 	Note that this doesn't work well together with having "longest" in
 	`'completeopt'` , because the completion from the search pattern may not
 	match the typed text.

## sh


```lua
vim.opt.shell
```

 `'shell'`  `'sh'` 		string	(default $SHELL or "sh", Win32: "cmd.exe")
 			global
 	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
 	value also check these options: `'shellpipe'` , `'shellslash'` 
 	`'shellredir'` , `'shellquote'` , `'shellxquote'`  and `'shellcmdflag'` .
 	It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 
 	If the name of the shell contains a space, you need to enclose it in
 	quotes.  Example with quotes: >
 		:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f
 <	Note the backslash before each quote (to avoid starting a comment) and
 	each space (to avoid ending the option value), so better use |:let-&|
 	like this: >
 		:let &shell='"C:\Program Files\unix\sh.exe" -f'
 <	Also note that the "-f" is not inside the quotes, because it is not
 	part of the command name.
 
 	Rules regarding quotes:
 	1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside
 	   quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument
 	   "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
 	   arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
 	   `'shellcmdflag'` ”).
 	2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
 	   `'"abc"'` , `'"a"bc'` , `'a"b"c'` , `'ab"c"'`  and `'"a"b"c"'`  are all equivalent
 	   to just "abc".
 	3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.
 	   Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding
 	   anything else means backslash and next character literally:
 	   `'"a\\b"'`  is the same as "a\b", `'"a\\"b"'`  runs shell named literally
 	   `'a"b'` , `'"a\b"'`  is the same as "a\b" again.
 	4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used
 	   to escape quote: `'a\"b"'`  is the same as "a\b".
 	Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of
 	unescaping, so to keep yourself sane use |:let-&| like shown above.
 
 	To use PowerShell: >
 		let &shell = executable(`'pwsh'` ) ? `'pwsh'`  : `'powershell'` 
 		let &shellcmdflag = '-NoLogo -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Command [Console]::InputEncoding=[Console]::OutputEncoding=[System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new();$PSDefaultParameterValues[`''` Out-File:Encoding`''` ]=`''` utf8`''` ;'
 		let &shellredir = '2>&1 | %%{ "$_" } | Out-File %s; exit $LastExitCode'
 		let &shellpipe  = '2>&1 | %%{ "$_" } | Tee-Object %s; exit $LastExitCode'
 		set shellquote= shellxquote=
 
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shada


```lua
string
```

 `'shada'`  `'sd'` 		string	(default for
 				   Win32:  !,'100,<50,s10,h,rA:,rB:
 				   others: !,'100,<50,s10,h)
 			global
 	When non-empty, the shada file is read upon startup and written
 	when exiting Vim (see |shada-file|).  The string should be a comma-
 	separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
 	identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
 	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
 	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
 	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
 	the effect of their value.
 	CHAR	VALUE	~
 
 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
 
 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
 		the `'<'`  item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
 		start of a comment!
 
 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
 		(`'buftype'` ), unlisted (`'buflisted'` ), unnamed and buffers on
 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
 		buffers are stored.
 
 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
 		`'shada'`  is non-empty.
 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
 
 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
 		`'history'`  is used.
 
 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
 		saved.  When not included, the value of `'history'`  is used.
 
 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
 		saved.  `'"'`  is the old name for this item.
 		Also see the `'s'`  item below: limit specified in KiB.
 
 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
 		saved.  When not included, the value of `'history'`  is used.
 
 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and `'encoding'`  value is fixed
 		to UTF-8 as well.
 
 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
 
 	h	Disable the effect of `'hlsearch'`  when loading the shada
 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
 		has been used since the last search command.
 
 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
 		the `'n'` .  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
 		`'shadafile'`  option is set, that file name overrides the one
 		given here with `'shada'` .  Environment variables are
 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
 
 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
 		`','` ).  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
 
 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.
 
 	Example: >
 	    :set shada='50,<1000,s100,:0,n~/nvim/shada
 <
 	'50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
 			edited.
 	<1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
 			remembered.
 	s100		Items with contents occupying more then 100 KiB are
 			skipped.
 	:0		Command-line history will not be saved.
 	n~/nvim/shada	The name of the file to use is "~/nvim/shada".
 	no /		Since `'/'`  is not specified, the default will be used,
 			that is, save all of the search history, and also the
 			previous search and substitute patterns.
 	no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
 	no h		`'hlsearch'`  highlighting will be restored.
 
 	When setting `'shada'`  from an empty value you can use |:rshada| to
 	load the contents of the file, this is not done automatically.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shadafile


```lua
string
```

 `'shadafile'`  `'sdf'` 	string	(default: "")
 			global
 	When non-empty, overrides the file name used for |shada| (viminfo).
 	When equal to "NONE" no shada file will be read or written.
 	This option can be set with the |-i| command line flag.  The |--clean|
 	command line flag sets it to "NONE".
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shcf


```lua
vim.opt.shellcmdflag
```

 `'shellcmdflag'`  `'shcf'` 	string	(default: "-c"; Windows: "/s /c")
 			global
 	Flag passed to the shell to execute "!" and ":!" commands; e.g.,
 	`bash.exe -c ls` or `cmd.exe /s /c "dir"`.  For MS-Windows, the
 	default is set according to the value of `'shell'` , to reduce the need
 	to set this option by the user.
 	On Unix it can have more than one flag.  Each white space separated
 	part is passed as an argument to the shell command.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	See |shell-unquoting| which talks about separating this option into
 	multiple arguments.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shell


```lua
string
```

 `'shell'`  `'sh'` 		string	(default $SHELL or "sh", Win32: "cmd.exe")
 			global
 	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
 	value also check these options: `'shellpipe'` , `'shellslash'` 
 	`'shellredir'` , `'shellquote'` , `'shellxquote'`  and `'shellcmdflag'` .
 	It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 
 	If the name of the shell contains a space, you need to enclose it in
 	quotes.  Example with quotes: >
 		:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f

 	like this: >
 		:let &shell='"C:\Program Files\unix\sh.exe" -f'
 <	Also note that the "-f" is not inside the quotes, because it is not
 	part of the command name.
 
 	Rules regarding quotes:
 	1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside
 	   quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument
 	   "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
 	   arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
 	   `'shellcmdflag'` ”).
 	2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
 	   `'"abc"'` , `'"a"bc'` , `'a"b"c'` , `'ab"c"'`  and `'"a"b"c"'`  are all equivalent
 	   to just "abc".
 	3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.
 	   Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding
 	   anything else means backslash and next character literally:
 	   `'"a\\b"'`  is the same as "a\b", `'"a\\"b"'`  runs shell named literally
 	   `'a"b'` , `'"a\b"'`  is the same as "a\b" again.
 	4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used
 	   to escape quote: `'a\"b"'`  is the same as "a\b".
 	Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of

## shellcmdflag


```lua
string
```

 `'shellcmdflag'`  `'shcf'` 	string	(default: "-c"; Windows: "/s /c")
 			global
 	Flag passed to the shell to execute "!" and ":!" commands; e.g.,
 	`bash.exe -c ls` or `cmd.exe /s /c "dir"`.  For MS-Windows, the
 	default is set according to the value of `'shell'` , to reduce the need

 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shellpipe


```lua
string
```

 `'shellpipe'`  `'sp'` 	string	(default ">", "| tee", "|& tee" or "2>&1| tee")
 			global
 	String to be used to put the output of the ":make" command in the
 	error file.  See also |:make_makeprg|.  See |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes.
 	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
 	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
 	of this option).
 	For MS-Windows the default is "2>&1| tee".  The stdout and stderr are
 	saved in a file and echoed to the screen.
 	For Unix the default is "| tee".  The stdout of the compiler is saved
 	in a file and echoed to the screen.  If the `'shell'`  option is "csh" or
 	"tcsh" after initializations, the default becomes "|& tee".  If the
 	`'shell'`  option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh", "zsh-beta",
 	"bash", "fish", "ash" or "dash" the default becomes "2>&1| tee".  This
 	means that stderr is also included.  Before using the `'shell'`  option a
 	path is removed, thus "/bin/sh" uses "sh".
 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
 	and the other initializations, so that when the `'shell'`  option is set
 	there, the `'shellpipe'`  option changes automatically, unless it was
 	explicitly set before.
 	When `'shellpipe'`  is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
 	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a `'makeprg'` 
 	that writes to `'makeef'`  by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
 	want to include the `'makeef'` , set `'shellpipe'`  to a single space.
 	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
 	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
 	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shellquote


```lua
string
```

 `'shellquote'`  `'shq'` 	string	(default: ""; Windows, when `'shell'` 
 					contains "sh" somewhere: "\"")
 			global
 	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
 	the "!" and ":!" commands.  The redirection is kept outside of the
 	quoting.  See `'shellxquote'`  to include the redirection.  It's
 	probably not useful to set both options.
 	This is an empty string by default.  Only known to be useful for
 	third-party shells on Windows systems, such as the MKS Korn Shell
 	or bash, where it should be "\"".  The default is adjusted according
 	the value of `'shell'` , to reduce the need to set this option by the
 	user.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shellredir


```lua
string
```

 `'shellredir'`  `'srr'` 	string	(default ">", ">&" or ">%s 2>&1")
 			global
 	String to be used to put the output of a filter command in a temporary
 	file.  See also |:!|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces
 	and backslashes.
 	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
 	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
 	of this option).
 	The default is ">".  For Unix, if the `'shell'`  option is "csh" or
 	"tcsh" during initializations, the default becomes ">&".  If the
 	`'shell'`  option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh", "zsh-beta",
 	"bash" or "fish", the default becomes ">%s 2>&1".  This means that
 	stderr is also included.  For Win32, the Unix checks are done and
 	additionally "cmd" is checked for, which makes the default ">%s 2>&1".
 	Also, the same names with ".exe" appended are checked for.
 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
 	and the other initializations, so that when the `'shell'`  option is set
 	there, the `'shellredir'`  option changes automatically unless it was
 	explicitly set before.
 	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
 	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shellslash


```lua
boolean
```

 `'shellslash'`  `'ssl'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 			{only for MS-Windows}
 	When set, a forward slash is used when expanding file names.  This is
 	useful when a Unix-like shell is used instead of cmd.exe.  Backward
 	slashes can still be typed, but they are changed to forward slashes by
 	Vim.
 	Note that setting or resetting this option has no effect for some
 	existing file names, thus this option needs to be set before opening
 	any file for best results.  This might change in the future.
 	`'shellslash'`  only works when a backslash can be used as a path
 	separator.  To test if this is so use: >
 		if exists(`'+shellslash'` )
 <	Also see `'completeslash'` .

## shelltemp


```lua
boolean
```

 `'shelltemp'`  `'stmp'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, use temp files for shell commands.  When off use a pipe.
 	When using a pipe is not possible temp files are used anyway.
 	The advantage of using a pipe is that nobody can read the temp file
 	and the `'shell'`  command does not need to support redirection.
 	The advantage of using a temp file is that the file type and encoding
 	can be detected.
 	The |FilterReadPre|, |FilterReadPost| and |FilterWritePre|,
 	|FilterWritePost| autocommands event are not triggered when
 	`'shelltemp'`  is off.
 	|system()| does not respect this option, it always uses pipes.

## shellxescape


```lua
string
```

 `'shellxescape'`  `'sxe'` 	string	(default: "")
 			global
 	When `'shellxquote'`  is set to "(" then the characters listed in this
 	option will be escaped with a `'^'`  character.  This makes it possible
 	to execute most external commands with cmd.exe.

## shellxquote


```lua
string
```

 `'shellxquote'`  `'sxq'` 	string	(default: "", Windows: "\"")
 			global
 	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
 	the "!" and ":!" commands.  Includes the redirection.  See
 	`'shellquote'`  to exclude the redirection.  It's probably not useful
 	to set both options.
 	When the value is `'('`  then `')'`  is appended. When the value is `'"('` 
 	then `')"'`  is appended.
 	When the value is `'('`  then also see `'shellxescape'` .
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## shiftround


```lua
boolean
```

 `'shiftround'`  `'sr'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Round indent to multiple of `'shiftwidth'` .  Applies to > and <
 	commands.  CTRL-T and CTRL-D in Insert mode always round the indent to
 	a multiple of `'shiftwidth'`  (this is Vi compatible).

## shiftwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'shiftwidth'`  `'sw'` 	number	(default 8)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent.  Used for
 	|`'cindent'` |, |>>|, |<<|, etc.
 	When zero the `'ts'`  value will be used.  Use the |shiftwidth()|
 	function to get the effective shiftwidth value.

## shm


```lua
vim.opt.shortmess
```

 `'shortmess'`  `'shm'` 	string	(default "filnxtToOF")
 			global
 	This option helps to avoid all the |hit-enter| prompts caused by file
 	messages, for example  with CTRL-G, and to avoid some other messages.
 	It is a list of flags:
 	 flag	meaning when present	~
 	  f	use "(3 of 5)" instead of "(file 3 of 5)"
 	  i	use "[noeol]" instead of "[Incomplete last line]"
 	  l	use "999L, 888B" instead of "999 lines, 888 bytes"

 	  o	overwrite message for writing a file with subsequent
 		message for reading a file (useful for ":wn" or when
 		`'autowrite'`  on)
 	  O	message for reading a file overwrites any previous
 		message;  also for quickfix message (e.g., ":cn")
 	  s	don't give "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP" or
 		"search hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages; when using
 		the search count do not show "W" after the count message (see
 		S below)
 	  t	truncate file message at the start if it is too long
 		to fit on the command-line, "<" will appear in the left most
 		column; ignored in Ex mode
 	  T	truncate other messages in the middle if they are too
 		long to fit on the command line; "..." will appear in the
 		middle; ignored in Ex mode
 	  W	don't give "written" or "[w]" when writing a file
 	  A	don't give the "ATTENTION" message when an existing
 		swap file is found
 	  I	don't give the intro message when starting Vim,
 		see |:intro|
 	  c	don't give |ins-completion-menu| messages; for
 		example, "-- XXX completion (YYY)", "match 1 of 2", "The only
 		match", "Pattern not found", "Back at original", etc.
 	  C	don't give messages while scanning for ins-completion
 		items, for instance "scanning tags"
 	  q	use "recording" instead of "recording @a"
 	  F	don't give the file info when editing a file, like
 		`:silent` was used for the command
 	  S	do not show search count message when searching, e.g.
 		"[1/5]"
 
 	This gives you the opportunity to avoid that a change between buffers
 	requires you to hit <Enter>, but still gives as useful a message as
 	possible for the space available.  To get the whole message that you
 	would have got with `'shm'`  empty, use ":file!"
 	Useful values:
 	    shm=	No abbreviation of message.
 	    shm=a	Abbreviation, but no loss of information.
 	    shm=at	Abbreviation, and truncate message when necessary.

## shortmess


```lua
string
```

 `'shortmess'`  `'shm'` 	string	(default "filnxtToOF")
 			global
 	This option helps to avoid all the |hit-enter| prompts caused by file
 	messages, for example  with CTRL-G, and to avoid some other messages.

## showbreak


```lua
string
```

 `'showbreak'`  `'sbr'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	String to put at the start of lines that have been wrapped.  Useful
 	values are "> " or "+++ ": >
 		:set showbreak=>\
 <	Note the backslash to escape the trailing space.  It's easier like
 	this: >
 		:let &showbreak = '+++ '
 <	Only printable single-cell characters are allowed, excluding <Tab> and
 	comma (in a future version the comma might be used to separate the
 	part that is shown at the end and at the start of a line).
 	The |hl-NonText| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	Note that tabs after the showbreak will be displayed differently.
 	If you want the `'showbreak'`  to appear in between line numbers, add the
 	"n" flag to `'cpoptions'` .
 	A window-local value overrules a global value.  If the global value is
 	set and you want no value in the current window use NONE: >
 		:setlocal showbreak=NONE
 <

## showcmd


```lua
boolean
```

 `'showcmd'`  `'sc'` 		boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	Show (partial) command in the last line of the screen.  Set this
 	option off if your terminal is slow.
 	In Visual mode the size of the selected area is shown:
 	- When selecting characters within a line, the number of characters.
 	  If the number of bytes is different it is also displayed: "2-6"
 	  means two characters and six bytes.
 	- When selecting more than one line, the number of lines.
 	- When selecting a block, the size in screen characters:
 	  {lines}x{columns}.
 	This information can be displayed in an alternative location using the
 	`'showcmdloc'`  option, useful when `'cmdheight'`  is 0.

## showcmdloc


```lua
string
```

 `'showcmdloc'`  `'sloc'` 	string	(default "last")
 			global
 	This option can be used to display the (partially) entered command in
 	another location.  Possible values are:
 	  last		Last line of the screen (default).
 	  statusline	Status line of the current window.
 	  tabline	First line of the screen if `'showtabline'`  is enabled.
 	Setting this option to "statusline" or "tabline" means that these will
 	be redrawn whenever the command changes, which can be on every key
 	pressed.
 	The %S `'statusline'`  item can be used in `'statusline'`  or `'tabline'`  to
 	place the text.  Without a custom `'statusline'`  or `'tabline'`  it will be
 	displayed in a convenient location.

## showfulltag


```lua
boolean
```

 `'showfulltag'`  `'sft'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	When completing a word in insert mode (see |ins-completion|) from the
 	tags file, show both the tag name and a tidied-up form of the search
 	pattern (if there is one) as possible matches.  Thus, if you have
 	matched a C function, you can see a template for what arguments are
 	required (coding style permitting).
 	Note that this doesn't work well together with having "longest" in
 	`'completeopt'` , because the completion from the search pattern may not
 	match the typed text.

## showmatch


```lua
boolean
```

 `'showmatch'`  `'sm'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When a bracket is inserted, briefly jump to the matching one.  The
 	jump is only done if the match can be seen on the screen.  The time to
 	show the match can be set with `'matchtime'` .
 	A Beep is given if there is no match (no matter if the match can be
 	seen or not).
 	When the `'m'`  flag is not included in `'cpoptions'` , typing a character
 	will immediately move the cursor back to where it belongs.
 	See the "sm" field in `'guicursor'`  for setting the cursor shape and
 	blinking when showing the match.
 	The `'matchpairs'`  option can be used to specify the characters to show
 	matches for.  `'rightleft'`  and `'revins'`  are used to look for opposite
 	matches.
 	Also see the matchparen plugin for highlighting the match when moving
 	around |pi_paren.txt|.
 	Note: Use of the short form is rated PG.

## showmode


```lua
boolean
```

 `'showmode'`  `'smd'` 	boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	If in Insert, Replace or Visual mode put a message on the last line.
 	The |hl-ModeMsg| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	The option has no effect when `'cmdheight'`  is zero.

## showtabline


```lua
integer
```

 `'showtabline'`  `'stal'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The value of this option specifies when the line with tab page labels
 	will be displayed:
 		0: never
 		1: only if there are at least two tab pages
 		2: always
 	This is both for the GUI and non-GUI implementation of the tab pages
 	line.
 	See |tab-page| for more information about tab pages.

## shq


```lua
vim.opt.shellquote
```

 `'shellquote'`  `'shq'` 	string	(default: ""; Windows, when `'shell'` 
 					contains "sh" somewhere: "\"")
 			global
 	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
 	the "!" and ":!" commands.  The redirection is kept outside of the
 	quoting.  See `'shellxquote'`  to include the redirection.  It's
 	probably not useful to set both options.
 	This is an empty string by default.  Only known to be useful for
 	third-party shells on Windows systems, such as the MKS Korn Shell
 	or bash, where it should be "\"".  The default is adjusted according
 	the value of `'shell'` , to reduce the need to set this option by the
 	user.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## si


```lua
vim.opt.smartindent
```

 `'smartindent'`  `'si'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Do smart autoindenting when starting a new line.  Works for C-like
 	programs, but can also be used for other languages.  `'cindent'`  does
 	something like this, works better in most cases, but is more strict,
 	see |C-indenting|.  When `'cindent'`  is on or `'indentexpr'`  is set,
 	setting `'si'`  has no effect.  `'indentexpr'`  is a more advanced
 	alternative.
 	Normally `'autoindent'`  should also be on when using `'smartindent'` .
 	An indent is automatically inserted:
 	- After a line ending in "{".
 	- After a line starting with a keyword from `'cinwords'` .
 	- Before a line starting with "}" (only with the "O" command).
 	When typing `'}'`  as the first character in a new line, that line is
 	given the same indent as the matching "{".
 	When typing `'#'`  as the first character in a new line, the indent for
 	that line is removed, the `'#'`  is put in the first column.  The indent
 	is restored for the next line.  If you don't want this, use this
 	mapping: ":inoremap # X^H#", where ^H is entered with CTRL-V CTRL-H.
 	When using the ">>" command, lines starting with `'#'`  are not shifted
 	right.

## sidescroll


```lua
integer
```

 `'sidescroll'`  `'ss'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The minimal number of columns to scroll horizontally.  Used only when
 	the `'wrap'`  option is off and the cursor is moved off of the screen.
 	When it is zero the cursor will be put in the middle of the screen.
 	When using a slow terminal set it to a large number or 0.  Not used
 	for "zh" and "zl" commands.

## sidescrolloff


```lua
integer
```

 `'sidescrolloff'`  `'siso'` 	number (default 0)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	The minimal number of screen columns to keep to the left and to the
 	right of the cursor if `'nowrap'`  is set.  Setting this option to a
 	value greater than 0 while having |`'sidescroll'` | also at a non-zero
 	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
 	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
 	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
 	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too
 	close to the beginning of the line.
 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
 	these two: >
 		setlocal sidescrolloff<
 		setlocal sidescrolloff=-1
 <
 	Example: Try this together with `'sidescroll'`  and `'listchars'`  as
 		 in the following example to never allow the cursor to move
 		 onto the "extends" character: >
 
 		 :set nowrap sidescroll=1 listchars=extends:>,precedes:<
 		 :set sidescrolloff=1
 <

## signcolumn


```lua
string
```

 `'signcolumn'`  `'scl'` 	string	(default "auto")
 			local to window
 	When and how to draw the signcolumn. Valid values are:
 	   "auto"	only when there is a sign to display
 	   "auto:[1-9]" resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
 	                given number (maximum 9), e.g. "auto:4"
 	   "auto:[1-8]-[2-9]"
 	                resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
 			given maximum number (maximum 9) while keeping
 			at least the given minimum (maximum 8) fixed
 			space. The minimum number should always be less
 			than the maximum number, e.g. "auto:2-5"
 	   "no"		never
 	   "yes"	always
 	   "yes:[1-9]"  always, with fixed space for signs up to the given
 	                number (maximum 9), e.g. "yes:3"
 	   "number"	display signs in the `'number'`  column. If the number
 			column is not present, then behaves like "auto".
 
 	Note regarding "orphaned signs": with signcolumn numbers higher than
 	1, deleting lines will also remove the associated signs automatically,
 	in contrast to the default Vim behavior of keeping and grouping them.
 	This is done in order for the signcolumn appearance not appear weird
 	during line deletion.

## siso


```lua
vim.opt.sidescrolloff
```

 `'sidescrolloff'`  `'siso'` 	number (default 0)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	The minimal number of screen columns to keep to the left and to the
 	right of the cursor if `'nowrap'`  is set.  Setting this option to a
 	value greater than 0 while having |`'sidescroll'` | also at a non-zero
 	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
 	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
 	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
 	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too
 	close to the beginning of the line.
 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
 	these two: >
 		setlocal sidescrolloff<
 		setlocal sidescrolloff=-1
 <
 	Example: Try this together with `'sidescroll'`  and `'listchars'`  as
 		 in the following example to never allow the cursor to move
 		 onto the "extends" character: >
 
 		 :set nowrap sidescroll=1 listchars=extends:>,precedes:<
 		 :set sidescrolloff=1
 <

## sj


```lua
vim.opt.scrolljump
```

 `'scrolljump'`  `'sj'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	Minimal number of lines to scroll when the cursor gets off the
 	screen (e.g., with "j").  Not used for scroll commands (e.g., CTRL-E,
 	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.
 	When set to a negative number from -1 to -100 this is used as the
 	percentage of the window height.  Thus -50 scrolls half the window
 	height.

## slm


```lua
vim.opt.selectmode
```

 `'selectmode'`  `'slm'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This is a comma-separated list of words, which specifies when to start
 	Select mode instead of Visual mode, when a selection is started.
 	Possible values:
 	   mouse	when using the mouse
 	   key		when using shifted special keys
 	   cmd		when using "v", "V" or CTRL-V
 	See |Select-mode|.
 	The `'selectmode'`  option is set by the |:behave| command.

## sloc


```lua
vim.opt.showcmdloc
```

 `'showcmdloc'`  `'sloc'` 	string	(default "last")
 			global
 	This option can be used to display the (partially) entered command in
 	another location.  Possible values are:
 	  last		Last line of the screen (default).
 	  statusline	Status line of the current window.
 	  tabline	First line of the screen if `'showtabline'`  is enabled.
 	Setting this option to "statusline" or "tabline" means that these will
 	be redrawn whenever the command changes, which can be on every key
 	pressed.
 	The %S `'statusline'`  item can be used in `'statusline'`  or `'tabline'`  to
 	place the text.  Without a custom `'statusline'`  or `'tabline'`  it will be
 	displayed in a convenient location.

## sm


```lua
vim.opt.showmatch
```

 `'showmatch'`  `'sm'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When a bracket is inserted, briefly jump to the matching one.  The
 	jump is only done if the match can be seen on the screen.  The time to
 	show the match can be set with `'matchtime'` .
 	A Beep is given if there is no match (no matter if the match can be
 	seen or not).
 	When the `'m'`  flag is not included in `'cpoptions'` , typing a character
 	will immediately move the cursor back to where it belongs.
 	See the "sm" field in `'guicursor'`  for setting the cursor shape and
 	blinking when showing the match.
 	The `'matchpairs'`  option can be used to specify the characters to show
 	matches for.  `'rightleft'`  and `'revins'`  are used to look for opposite
 	matches.
 	Also see the matchparen plugin for highlighting the match when moving
 	around |pi_paren.txt|.
 	Note: Use of the short form is rated PG.

## smartcase


```lua
boolean
```

 `'smartcase'`  `'scs'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Override the `'ignorecase'`  option if the search pattern contains upper
 	case characters.  Only used when the search pattern is typed and
 	`'ignorecase'`  option is on.  Used for the commands "/", "?", "n", "N",
 	":g" and ":s".  Not used for "*", "#", "gd", tag search, etc.  After
 	"*" and "#" you can make `'smartcase'`  used by doing a "/" command,
 	recalling the search pattern from history and hitting <Enter>.

## smartindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'smartindent'`  `'si'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Do smart autoindenting when starting a new line.  Works for C-like
 	programs, but can also be used for other languages.  `'cindent'`  does
 	something like this, works better in most cases, but is more strict,
 	see |C-indenting|.  When `'cindent'`  is on or `'indentexpr'`  is set,
 	setting `'si'`  has no effect.  `'indentexpr'`  is a more advanced
 	alternative.
 	Normally `'autoindent'`  should also be on when using `'smartindent'` .
 	An indent is automatically inserted:
 	- After a line ending in "{".
 	- After a line starting with a keyword from `'cinwords'` .
 	- Before a line starting with "}" (only with the "O" command).
 	When typing `'}'`  as the first character in a new line, that line is
 	given the same indent as the matching "{".
 	When typing `'#'`  as the first character in a new line, the indent for
 	that line is removed, the `'#'`  is put in the first column.  The indent
 	is restored for the next line.  If you don't want this, use this
 	mapping: ":inoremap # X^H#", where ^H is entered with CTRL-V CTRL-H.
 	When using the ">>" command, lines starting with `'#'`  are not shifted
 	right.

## smarttab


```lua
boolean
```

 `'smarttab'`  `'sta'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, a <Tab> in front of a line inserts blanks according to
 	`'shiftwidth'` .  `'tabstop'`  or `'softtabstop'`  is used in other places.  A
 	<BS> will delete a `'shiftwidth'`  worth of space at the start of the
 	line.
 	When off, a <Tab> always inserts blanks according to `'tabstop'`  or
 	`'softtabstop'` .  `'shiftwidth'`  is only used for shifting text left or
 	right |shift-left-right|.
 	What gets inserted (a <Tab> or spaces) depends on the `'expandtab'` 
 	option.  Also see |ins-expandtab|.  When `'expandtab'`  is not set, the
 	number of spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.

## smc


```lua
vim.opt.synmaxcol
```

 `'synmaxcol'`  `'smc'` 	number	(default 3000)
 			local to buffer
 	Maximum column in which to search for syntax items.  In long lines the
 	text after this column is not highlighted and following lines may not
 	be highlighted correctly, because the syntax state is cleared.
 	This helps to avoid very slow redrawing for an XML file that is one
 	long line.
 	Set to zero to remove the limit.

## smd


```lua
vim.opt.showmode
```

 `'showmode'`  `'smd'` 	boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	If in Insert, Replace or Visual mode put a message on the last line.
 	The |hl-ModeMsg| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	The option has no effect when `'cmdheight'`  is zero.

## so


```lua
vim.opt.scrolloff
```

 `'scrolloff'`  `'so'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
 	This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
 	you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
 	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
 	when long lines wrap).
 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
 	these two: >
 		setlocal scrolloff<
 		setlocal scrolloff=-1
 <	For scrolling horizontally see `'sidescrolloff'` .

## softtabstop


```lua
integer
```

 `'softtabstop'`  `'sts'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while performing editing
 	operations, like inserting a <Tab> or using <BS>.  It "feels" like
 	<Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mix of spaces and <Tab>s is
 	used.  This is useful to keep the `'ts'`  setting at its standard value
 	of 8, while being able to edit like it is set to `'sts'` .  However,
 	commands like "x" still work on the actual characters.
 	When `'sts'`  is zero, this feature is off.
 	When `'sts'`  is negative, the value of `'shiftwidth'`  is used.
 	See also |ins-expandtab|.  When `'expandtab'`  is not set, the number of
 	spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
 	The `'L'`  flag in `'cpoptions'`  changes how tabs are used when `'list'`  is
 	set.
 
 	The value of `'softtabstop'`  will be ignored if |`'varsofttabstop'` | is set
 	to anything other than an empty string.

## sol


```lua
vim.opt.startofline
```

 `'startofline'`  `'sol'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When "on" the commands listed below move the cursor to the first
 	non-blank of the line.  When off the cursor is kept in the same column
 	(if possible).  This applies to the commands: CTRL-D, CTRL-U, CTRL-B,
 	CTRL-F, "G", "H", "M", "L", gg, and to the commands "d", "<<" and ">>"
 	with a linewise operator, with "%" with a count and to buffer changing
 	commands (CTRL-^, :bnext, :bNext, etc.).  Also for an Ex command that
 	only has a line number, e.g., ":25" or ":+".
 	In case of buffer changing commands the cursor is placed at the column
 	where it was the last time the buffer was edited.

## sp


```lua
vim.opt.shellpipe
```

 `'shellpipe'`  `'sp'` 	string	(default ">", "| tee", "|& tee" or "2>&1| tee")
 			global
 	String to be used to put the output of the ":make" command in the
 	error file.  See also |:make_makeprg|.  See |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes.
 	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
 	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
 	of this option).
 	For MS-Windows the default is "2>&1| tee".  The stdout and stderr are
 	saved in a file and echoed to the screen.
 	For Unix the default is "| tee".  The stdout of the compiler is saved
 	in a file and echoed to the screen.  If the `'shell'`  option is "csh" or
 	"tcsh" after initializations, the default becomes "|& tee".  If the
 	`'shell'`  option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh", "zsh-beta",
 	"bash", "fish", "ash" or "dash" the default becomes "2>&1| tee".  This
 	means that stderr is also included.  Before using the `'shell'`  option a
 	path is removed, thus "/bin/sh" uses "sh".
 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
 	and the other initializations, so that when the `'shell'`  option is set
 	there, the `'shellpipe'`  option changes automatically, unless it was
 	explicitly set before.
 	When `'shellpipe'`  is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
 	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a `'makeprg'` 
 	that writes to `'makeef'`  by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
 	want to include the `'makeef'` , set `'shellpipe'`  to a single space.
 	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
 	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
 	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## spc


```lua
vim.opt.spellcapcheck
```

 `'spellcapcheck'`  `'spc'` 	string	(default "[.?!]\_[\])'" \t]\+")
 			local to buffer
 	Pattern to locate the end of a sentence.  The following word will be
 	checked to start with a capital letter.  If not then it is highlighted
 	with SpellCap |hl-SpellCap| (unless the word is also badly spelled).
 	When this check is not wanted make this option empty.
 	Only used when `'spell'`  is set.
 	Be careful with special characters, see |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes.
 	To set this option automatically depending on the language, see
 	|set-spc-auto|.

## spell


```lua
boolean
```

 `'spell'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	When on spell checking will be done.  See |spell|.
 	The languages are specified with `'spelllang'` .

## spellcapcheck


```lua
string
```

 `'spellcapcheck'`  `'spc'` 	string	(default "[.?!]\_[\])'" \t]\+")
 			local to buffer
 	Pattern to locate the end of a sentence.  The following word will be
 	checked to start with a capital letter.  If not then it is highlighted
 	with SpellCap |hl-SpellCap| (unless the word is also badly spelled).
 	When this check is not wanted make this option empty.
 	Only used when `'spell'`  is set.
 	Be careful with special characters, see |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes.
 	To set this option automatically depending on the language, see
 	|set-spc-auto|.

## spellfile


```lua
string
```

 `'spellfile'`  `'spf'` 	string	(default empty)
 			local to buffer
 	Name of the word list file where words are added for the |zg| and |zw|
 	commands.  It must end in ".{encoding}.add".  You need to include the
 	path, otherwise the file is placed in the current directory.
 
 	It may also be a comma-separated list of names.  A count before the
 	|zg| and |zw| commands can be used to access each.  This allows using
 	a personal word list file and a project word list file.
 	When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
 	you: Using the first directory in `'runtimepath'`  that is writable.  If
 	there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
 	name the first language name that appears in `'spelllang'`  is used,
 	ignoring the region.
 	The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
 	have to appear in `'spelllang'` .
 	Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
 	name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
 	`'spellfile'`  is set to it, for entries in `'spelllang'`  only files
 	without region name will be found.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## spelllang


```lua
string
```

 `'spelllang'`  `'spl'` 	string	(default "en")
 			local to buffer
 	A comma-separated list of word list names.  When the `'spell'`  option is
 	on spellchecking will be done for these languages.  Example: >
 		set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical
 <	This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
 	that are not recognized will be highlighted.
 	The word list name must consist of alphanumeric characters, a dash or
 	an underscore.  It should not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
 	recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
 	specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
 	A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
 	the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
 	region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
 	English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
 	Britain. (Note: currently en_au and en_nz dictionaries are older than
 	en_ca, en_gb and en_us).
 	If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
 	spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
 	words.
 	Note that the "medical" dictionary does not exist, it is just an
 	example of a longer name.
 
 	As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
 	first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
 	(_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
 	This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
 	encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
 	How the related spell files are found is explained here: |spell-load|.
 
 	If the |spellfile.vim| plugin is active and you use a language name
 	for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in `'runtimepath'`  the plugin
 	will ask you if you want to download the file.
 
 	After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
 	"spell/LANG.vim" in `'runtimepath'` .  "LANG" is the value of `'spelllang'` 
 	up to the first character that is not an ASCII letter or number and
 	not a dash.  Also see |set-spc-auto|.

## spelloptions


```lua
string
```

 `'spelloptions'`  `'spo'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	A comma-separated list of options for spell checking:
 	camel		When a word is CamelCased, assume "Cased" is a
 			separate word: every upper-case character in a word
 			that comes after a lower case character indicates the
 			start of a new word.
 	noplainbuffer	Only spellcheck a buffer when `'syntax'`  is enabled,
 			or when extmarks are set within the buffer. Only
 			designated regions of the buffer are spellchecked in
 			this case.

## spellsuggest


```lua
string
```

 `'spellsuggest'`  `'sps'` 	string	(default "best")
 			global
 	Methods used for spelling suggestions.  Both for the |z=| command and
 	the |spellsuggest()| function.  This is a comma-separated list of
 	items:
 
 	best		Internal method that works best for English.  Finds
 			changes like "fast" and uses a bit of sound-a-like
 			scoring to improve the ordering.
 
 	double		Internal method that uses two methods and mixes the
 			results.  The first method is "fast", the other method
 			computes how much the suggestion sounds like the bad
 			word.  That only works when the language specifies
 			sound folding.  Can be slow and doesn't always give
 			better results.
 
 	fast		Internal method that only checks for simple changes:
 			character inserts/deletes/swaps.  Works well for
 			simple typing mistakes.
 
 	{number}	The maximum number of suggestions listed for |z=|.
 			Not used for |spellsuggest()|.  The number of
 			suggestions is never more than the value of `'lines'` 
 			minus two.
 
 	timeout:{millisec}   Limit the time searching for suggestions to
 			{millisec} milli seconds.  Applies to the following
 			methods.  When omitted the limit is 5000. When
 			negative there is no limit.
 
 	file:{filename} Read file {filename}, which must have two columns,
 			separated by a slash.  The first column contains the
 			bad word, the second column the suggested good word.
 			Example:
 				theribal/terrible ~
 			Use this for common mistakes that do not appear at the
 			top of the suggestion list with the internal methods.
 			Lines without a slash are ignored, use this for
 			comments.
 			The word in the second column must be correct,
 			otherwise it will not be used.  Add the word to an
 			".add" file if it is currently flagged as a spelling
 			mistake.
 			The file is used for all languages.
 
 	expr:{expr}	Evaluate expression {expr}.  Use a function to avoid
 			trouble with spaces.  |v:val| holds the badly spelled
 			word.  The expression must evaluate to a List of
 			Lists, each with a suggestion and a score.
 			Example:
 				[[`'the'` , 33], [`'that'` , 44]] ~
 			Set `'verbose'`  and use |z=| to see the scores that the
 			internal methods use.  A lower score is better.
 			This may invoke |spellsuggest()| if you temporarily
 			set `'spellsuggest'`  to exclude the "expr:" part.
 			Errors are silently ignored, unless you set the
 			`'verbose'`  option to a non-zero value.
 
 	Only one of "best", "double" or "fast" may be used.  The others may
 	appear several times in any order.  Example: >
 		:set sps=file:~/.config/nvim/sugg,best,expr:MySuggest()
 <
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## spf


```lua
vim.opt.spellfile
```

 `'spellfile'`  `'spf'` 	string	(default empty)
 			local to buffer

## spk


```lua
vim.opt.splitkeep
```

 `'splitkeep'`  `'spk'` 	string	(default "cursor")
 			global
 	The value of this option determines the scroll behavior when opening,
 	closing or resizing horizontal splits.
 
 	Possible values are:
 	  cursor	Keep the same relative cursor position.
 	  screen	Keep the text on the same screen line.
 	  topline	Keep the topline the same.
 
 	For the "screen" and "topline" values, the cursor position will be
 	changed when necessary. In this case, the jumplist will be populated
 	with the previous cursor position. For "screen", the text cannot always
 	be kept on the same screen line when `'wrap'`  is enabled.

## spl


```lua
vim.opt.spelllang

 `'splitbelow'`  `'sb'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, splitting a window will put the new window below the current
 	one. |:split|

## splitkeep


```lua

## sr


```lua
vim.opt.shiftround
```

 `'shiftround'`  `'sr'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Round indent to multiple of `'shiftwidth'` .  Applies to > and <
 	commands.  CTRL-T and CTRL-D in Insert mode always round the indent to
 	a multiple of `'shiftwidth'`  (this is Vi compatible).

## srr


```lua
vim.opt.shellredir
```

 `'shellredir'`  `'srr'` 	string	(default ">", ">&" or ">%s 2>&1")
 			global
 	String to be used to put the output of a filter command in a temporary
 	file.  See also |:!|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces
 	and backslashes.
 	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
 	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
 	of this option).
 	The default is ">".  For Unix, if the `'shell'`  option is "csh" or
 	"tcsh" during initializations, the default becomes ">&".  If the
 	`'shell'`  option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh", "zsh-beta",
 	"bash" or "fish", the default becomes ">%s 2>&1".  This means that
 	stderr is also included.  For Win32, the Unix checks are done and
 	additionally "cmd" is checked for, which makes the default ">%s 2>&1".
 	Also, the same names with ".exe" appended are checked for.
 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
 	and the other initializations, so that when the `'shell'`  option is set
 	there, the `'shellredir'`  option changes automatically unless it was
 	explicitly set before.
 	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will

## ss


```lua
vim.opt.sidescroll
```

 `'sidescroll'`  `'ss'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The minimal number of columns to scroll horizontally.  Used only when
 	the `'wrap'`  option is off and the cursor is moved off of the screen.
 	When it is zero the cursor will be put in the middle of the screen.
 	When using a slow terminal set it to a large number or 0.  Not used
 	for "zh" and "zl" commands.

## ssl


```lua
vim.opt.shellslash
```

 `'shellslash'`  `'ssl'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 			{only for MS-Windows}
 	When set, a forward slash is used when expanding file names.  This is
 	useful when a Unix-like shell is used instead of cmd.exe.  Backward
 	slashes can still be typed, but they are changed to forward slashes by
 	Vim.
 	Note that setting or resetting this option has no effect for some
 	existing file names, thus this option needs to be set before opening
 	any file for best results.  This might change in the future.
 	`'shellslash'`  only works when a backslash can be used as a path
 	separator.  To test if this is so use: >
 		if exists(`'+shellslash'` )
 <	Also see `'completeslash'` .

## ssop


```lua

 	   buffers	hidden and unloaded buffers, not just those in windows
 	   curdir	the current directory
 	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
 			fold options
 	   globals	global variables that start with an uppercase letter
 			and contain at least one lowercase letter.  Only
 			String and Number types are stored.
 	   help		the help window
 	   localoptions	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
 			global values for local options)
 	   options	all options and mappings (also global values for local
 			options)
 	   skiprtp	exclude `'runtimepath'`  and `'packpath'`  from the options
 	   resize	size of the Vim window: `'lines'`  and `'columns'` 
 	   sesdir	the directory in which the session file is located
 			will become the current directory (useful with
 			projects accessed over a network from different
 			systems)
 	   tabpages	all tab pages; without this only the current tab page
 			is restored, so that you can make a session for each
 			tab page separately
 	   terminal	include terminal windows where the command can be
 			restored
 	   winpos	position of the whole Vim window
 	   winsize	window sizes
 	   slash	|deprecated| Always enabled. Uses "/" in filenames.
 	   unix		|deprecated| Always enabled. Uses "\n" line endings.

 	filenames are stored as absolute paths.
 	If you leave out "options" many things won't work well after restoring
 	the session.

## sta


```lua
vim.opt.smarttab
```

 `'smarttab'`  `'sta'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, a <Tab> in front of a line inserts blanks according to
 	`'shiftwidth'` .  `'tabstop'`  or `'softtabstop'`  is used in other places.  A
 	<BS> will delete a `'shiftwidth'`  worth of space at the start of the
 	line.
 	When off, a <Tab> always inserts blanks according to `'tabstop'`  or
 	`'softtabstop'` .  `'shiftwidth'`  is only used for shifting text left or
 	right |shift-left-right|.
 	What gets inserted (a <Tab> or spaces) depends on the `'expandtab'` 
 	option.  Also see |ins-expandtab|.  When `'expandtab'`  is not set, the
 	number of spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.

## stal


```lua
vim.opt.showtabline
```

 `'showtabline'`  `'stal'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The value of this option specifies when the line with tab page labels
 	will be displayed:
 		0: never
 		1: only if there are at least two tab pages
 		2: always
 	This is both for the GUI and non-GUI implementation of the tab pages
 	line.
 	See |tab-page| for more information about tab pages.

## startofline


```lua
boolean
```

 `'startofline'`  `'sol'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When "on" the commands listed below move the cursor to the first
 	non-blank of the line.  When off the cursor is kept in the same column
 	(if possible).  This applies to the commands: CTRL-D, CTRL-U, CTRL-B,
 	CTRL-F, "G", "H", "M", "L", gg, and to the commands "d", "<<" and ">>"
 	with a linewise operator, with "%" with a count and to buffer changing
 	commands (CTRL-^, :bnext, :bNext, etc.).  Also for an Ex command that
 	only has a line number, e.g., ":25" or ":+".
 	In case of buffer changing commands the cursor is placed at the column
 	where it was the last time the buffer was edited.

## statuscolumn


```lua
string
```

 `'statuscolumn'`  `'stc'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			local to window
 	EXPERIMENTAL
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the area to the
 	side of a window, normally containing the fold, sign and number columns.
 	The format of this option is like that of `'statusline'` .
 
 	Some of the items from the `'statusline'`  format are different for
 	`'statuscolumn'` :
 
 	%l	line number of currently drawn line
 	%r	relative line number of currently drawn line
 	%s	sign column for currently drawn line
 	%C	fold column for currently drawn line
 
 	NOTE: To draw the sign and fold columns, their items must be included in
 	`'statuscolumn'` . Even when they are not included, the status column width
 	will adapt to the `'signcolumn'`  and `'foldcolumn'`  width.
 
 	The |v:lnum|    variable holds the line number to be drawn.
 	The |v:relnum|  variable holds the relative line number to be drawn.
 	The |v:virtnum| variable is negative when drawing virtual lines, zero
 		      when drawing the actual buffer line, and positive when
 		      drawing the wrapped part of a buffer line.
 
 	NOTE: The %@ click execute function item is supported as well but the
 	specified function will be the same for each row in the same column.
 	It cannot be switched out through a dynamic `'statuscolumn'`  format, the
 	handler should be written with this in mind.
 
 	Examples: >vim
 		" Relative number with bar separator and click handlers:
 		:set statuscolumn=%@SignCb@%s%=%T%@NumCb@%r│%T
 
 		" Right aligned relative cursor line number:
 		:let &stc='%=%{v:relnum?v:relnum:v:lnum} '
 
 		" Line numbers in hexadecimal for non wrapped part of lines:
 		:let &stc='%=%{v:virtnum>0?"":printf("%x",v:lnum)} '
 
 		" Human readable line numbers with thousands separator:
 		:let &stc=`'%{substitute(v:lnum,"\\d\\zs\\ze\\'` 
 			   . `'%(\\d\\d\\d\\)\\+$",",","g")}'` 
 
 		" Both relative and absolute line numbers with different
 		" highlighting for odd and even relative numbers:
 		:let &stc=`'%#NonText#%{&nu?v:lnum:""}'`  .
 		 '%=%{&rnu&&(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}' .
 		 '%#LineNr#%{&rnu&&!(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}'
 
 <	WARNING: this expression is evaluated for each screen line so defining
 	an expensive expression can negatively affect render performance.

## statusline


```lua
string
```

 `'statusline'`  `'stl'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the status line.
 	Also see |status-line|.
 
 	The option consists of printf style `'%'`  items interspersed with
 	normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
 	  %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
 	All fields except the {item} are optional.  A single percent sign can
 	be given as "%%".
 
 	When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
 	evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example: >
 		:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
 <	The  variable will be set to the |window-ID| of the
 	window that the status line belongs to.
 	The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
 	Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
 	current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
 	context of the window that the statusline belongs to.
 
 	When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
 	empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.
 	When the result contains unprintable characters the result is
 	unpredictable.
 
 	Note that the only effect of `'ruler'`  when this option is set (and
 	`'laststatus'`  is 2 or 3) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.
 
 	field	    meaning ~
 	-	    Left justify the item.  The default is right justified
 		    when minwid is larger than the length of the item.
 	0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by "-".
 	minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by "-" & "0".
 		    Value must be 50 or less.
 	maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a "<"
 		    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be
 		    shifted down to maxwid-2 digits followed by ">"number
 		    where number is the amount of missing digits, much like
 		    an exponential notation.
 	item	    A one letter code as described below.
 
 	Following is a description of the possible statusline items.  The
 	second character in "item" is the type:
 		N for number
 		S for string
 		F for flags as described below
 		- not applicable
 
 	item  meaning ~
 	f S   Path to the file in the buffer, as typed or relative to current
 	      directory.
 	F S   Full path to the file in the buffer.
 	t S   File name (tail) of file in the buffer.
 	m F   Modified flag, text is "[+]"; "[-]" if `'modifiable'`  is off.
 	M F   Modified flag, text is ",+" or ",-".
 	r F   Readonly flag, text is "[RO]".
 	R F   Readonly flag, text is ",RO".
 	h F   Help buffer flag, text is "[help]".
 	H F   Help buffer flag, text is ",HLP".
 	w F   Preview window flag, text is "[Preview]".
 	W F   Preview window flag, text is ",PRV".
 	y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., "[vim]".  See `'filetype'` .
 	Y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., ",VIM".  See `'filetype'` .
 	q S   "[Quickfix List]", "[Location List]" or empty.
 	k S   Value of "b:keymap_name" or `'keymap'`  when |:lmap| mappings are
 	      being used: "<keymap>"
 	n N   Buffer number.
 	b N   Value of character under cursor.
 	B N   As above, in hexadecimal.
 	o N   Byte number in file of byte under cursor, first byte is 1.
 	      Mnemonic: Offset from start of file (with one added)
 	O N   As above, in hexadecimal.
 	l N   Line number.
 	L N   Number of lines in buffer.
 	c N   Column number (byte index).
 	v N   Virtual column number (screen column).
 	V N   Virtual column number as -{num}.  Not displayed if equal to `'c'` .
 	p N   Percentage through file in lines as in |CTRL-G|.
 	P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the
 	      percentage described for `'ruler'` .  Always 3 in length, unless
 	      translated.
 	S S   `'showcmd'`  content, see `'showcmdloc'` .
 	a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
 	      Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
 	{ NF  Evaluate expression between "%{" and "}" and substitute result.
 	      Note that there is no "%" before the closing "}".  The
 	      expression cannot contain a "}" character, call a function to
 	      work around that.  See |stl-%{| below.
 	`{%` -  This is almost same as "{" except the result of the expression is
 	      re-evaluated as a statusline format string.  Thus if the
 	      return value of expr contains "%" items they will get expanded.
 	      The expression can contain the "}" character, the end of
 	      expression is denoted by "%}".
 	      For example: >
 		func! Stl_filename() abort
 		    return "%t"
 		endfunc
 <	        `stl=%{Stl_filename()}`   results in `"%t"`
 	        `stl=%{%Stl_filename()%}` results in `"Name of current file"`
 	%} -  End of "{%" expression
 	( -   Start of item group.  Can be used for setting the width and
 	      alignment of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
 	) -   End of item group.  No width fields allowed.
 	T N   For `'tabline'` : start of tab page N label.  Use %T or %X to end
 	      the label.  Clicking this label with left mouse button switches
 	      to the specified tab page.
 	X N   For `'tabline'` : start of close tab N label.  Use %X or %T to end
 	      the label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current
 	      tab" label.    Clicking this label with left mouse button closes
 	      specified tab page.
 	@ N   Start of execute function label. Use %X or %T to
 	      end the label, e.g.: %10@SwitchBuffer@foo.c%X.  Clicking this
 	      label runs specified function: in the example when clicking once
 	      using left mouse button on "foo.c" "SwitchBuffer(10, 1, `'l'` ,
 	      '    ')" expression will be run.  Function receives the
 	      following arguments in order:
 	      1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
 	      2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
 	      3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle
 	         button respectively; one should not rely on third argument
 	         being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value
 	         that contains only ASCII lower case letters may be expected
 	         for other mouse buttons
 	      4. modifiers pressed: string which contains "s" if shift
 	         modifier was pressed, "c" for control, "a" for alt and "m"
 	         for meta; currently if modifier is not pressed string
 	         contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence
 	         of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use |stridx()| to
 	         test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed
 	         to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per
 	         modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence
 	         is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was
 	         added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on
 	         this label.
 	      Use |getmousepos()|.winid in the specified function to get the
 	      corresponding window id of the clicked item.
 	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
 	      No width fields allowed.
 	= -   Separation point between alignment sections.  Each section will
 	      be separated by an equal number of spaces.  With one %= what
 	      comes after it will be right-aligned.  With two %= there is a
 	      middle part, with white space left and right of it.
 	      No width fields allowed.
 	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
 	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
 	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
 	      windows.
 	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
 	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
 	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine will be applied to
 	      StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
 	      The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|
 
 	When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
 	that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
 	when flags are used like in the examples below.
 
 	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
 	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
 	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
 	completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
 		:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
 <	Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
 	line is displayed.
 
 	While evaluating %{} the current buffer and current window will be set
 	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
 	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
 	The variable "g:actual_curbuf" is set to the `bufnr()` number of the
 	real current buffer and "g:actual_curwin" to the |window-ID| of the
 	real current window.  These values are strings.
 
 	The `'statusline'`  option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
 	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'statusline'`  |textlock|.
 
 	If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
 	a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
 	using `:redrawstatus`.
 
 	A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
 	Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
 	described above.
 
 	Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
 	If you are stuck, hold down `':'`  or `'Q'`  to get a prompt, then quit and
 	edit your vimrc or whatever with "vim --clean" to get it right.
 
 	Examples:
 	Emulate standard status line with `'ruler'`  set >
 	  :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
 <	Similar, but add ASCII value of char under the cursor (like "ga") >
 	  :set statusline=%<%f%h%m%r%=%b\ 0x%B\ \ %l,%c%V\ %P
 <	Display byte count and byte value, modified flag in red. >
 	  :set statusline=%<%f%=\ [%1%n%R%H]\ %-19(%3l,%02c%03V%)%O`'%02b'` 
 	  :hi User1 term=inverse,bold cterm=inverse,bold ctermfg=red
 <	Display a ,GZ flag if a compressed file is loaded >
 	  :set statusline=...%r%{VarExists(`'b:gzflag'` ,'\ [GZ]')}%h...
 <	In the |:autocmd|'s: >
 	  :let b:gzflag = 1
 <	And: >
 	  :unlet b:gzflag
 <	And define this function: >
 	  :function VarExists(var, val)
 	  :    if exists(a:var) | return a:val | else | return `''`  | endif

 	      1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
 	      2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
 	      3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle
 	         button respectively; one should not rely on third argument
 	         being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value
 	         that contains only ASCII lower case letters may be expected
 	         for other mouse buttons
 	      4. modifiers pressed: string which contains "s" if shift
 	         modifier was pressed, "c" for control, "a" for alt and "m"
 	         for meta; currently if modifier is not pressed string
 	         contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence
 	         of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use |stridx()| to
 	         test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed
 	         to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per
 	         modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence
 	         is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was
 	         added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on
 	         this label.
 	      Use |getmousepos()|.winid in the specified function to get the
 	      corresponding window id of the clicked item.
 	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
 	      No width fields allowed.
 	= -   Separation point between alignment sections.  Each section will
 	      be separated by an equal number of spaces.  With one %= what
 	      comes after it will be right-aligned.  With two %= there is a
 	      middle part, with white space left and right of it.
 	      No width fields allowed.
 	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
 	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
 	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
 	      windows.
 	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
 	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
 	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine will be applied to
 	      StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
 	      The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|
 
 	When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
 	that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
 	when flags are used like in the examples below.
 
 	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
 	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
 	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
 	completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
 		:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
 <	Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
 	line is displayed.
 
 	While evaluating %{} the current buffer and current window will be set
 	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
 	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
 	The variable "g:actual_curbuf" is set to the `bufnr()` number of the
 	real current buffer and "g:actual_curwin" to the |window-ID| of the
 	real current window.  These values are strings.
 
 	The `'statusline'`  option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
 	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'statusline'`  |textlock|.
 
 	If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
 	a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
 	using `:redrawstatus`.
 
 	A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
 	Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
 	described above.
 
 	Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
 	If you are stuck, hold down `':'`  or `'Q'`  to get a prompt, then quit and
 	edit your vimrc or whatever with "vim --clean" to get it right.
 
 	Examples:
 	Emulate standard status line with `'ruler'`  set >
 	  :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
 <	Similar, but add ASCII value of char under the cursor (like "ga") >
 	  :set statusline=%<%f%h%m%r%=%b\ 0x%B\ \ %l,%c%V\ %P
 <	Display byte count and byte value, modified flag in red. >
 	  :set statusline=%<%f%=\ [%1%n%R%H]\ %-19(%3l,%02c%03V%)%O`'%02b'` 
 	  :hi User1 term=inverse,bold cterm=inverse,bold ctermfg=red
 <	Display a ,GZ flag if a compressed file is loaded >

## stmp


```lua
vim.opt.shelltemp
```

 `'shelltemp'`  `'stmp'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, use temp files for shell commands.  When off use a pipe.
 	When using a pipe is not possible temp files are used anyway.
 	The advantage of using a pipe is that nobody can read the temp file
 	and the `'shell'`  command does not need to support redirection.
 	The advantage of using a temp file is that the file type and encoding
 	can be detected.
 	The |FilterReadPre|, |FilterReadPost| and |FilterWritePre|,
 	|FilterWritePost| autocommands event are not triggered when
 	`'shelltemp'`  is off.
 	|system()| does not respect this option, it always uses pipes.

## sts


```lua
vim.opt.softtabstop
```

 `'softtabstop'`  `'sts'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while performing editing
 	operations, like inserting a <Tab> or using <BS>.  It "feels" like
 	<Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mix of spaces and <Tab>s is
 	used.  This is useful to keep the `'ts'`  setting at its standard value
 	of 8, while being able to edit like it is set to `'sts'` .  However,
 	commands like "x" still work on the actual characters.
 	When `'sts'`  is zero, this feature is off.
 	When `'sts'`  is negative, the value of `'shiftwidth'`  is used.
 	See also |ins-expandtab|.  When `'expandtab'`  is not set, the number of
 	spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
 	The `'L'`  flag in `'cpoptions'`  changes how tabs are used when `'list'`  is
 	set.
 
 	The value of `'softtabstop'`  will be ignored if |`'varsofttabstop'` | is set
 	to anything other than an empty string.

## su


```lua
vim.opt.suffixes
```

 `'suffixes'`  `'su'` 		string	(default ".bak,~,.o,.h,.info,.swp,.obj")
 			global
 	Files with these suffixes get a lower priority when multiple files
 	match a wildcard.  See |suffixes|.  Commas can be used to separate the
 	suffixes.  Spaces after the comma are ignored.  A dot is also seen as
 	the start of a suffix.  To avoid a dot or comma being recognized as a
 	separator, precede it with a backslash (see |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes).
 	See `'wildignore'`  for completely ignoring files.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	suffixes from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.

## sua


```lua
vim.opt.suffixesadd
```

 `'suffixesadd'`  `'sua'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Comma-separated list of suffixes, which are used when searching for a
 	file for the "gf", "[I", etc. commands.  Example: >
 		:set suffixesadd=.java
 <

## suffixes

 `'suffixesadd'`  `'sua'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Comma-separated list of suffixes, which are used when searching for a
 	file for the "gf", "[I", etc. commands.  Example: >
 		:set suffixesadd=.java
 <

## sw


```lua
vim.opt.shiftwidth
```

 `'shiftwidth'`  `'sw'` 	number	(default 8)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent.  Used for
 	|`'cindent'` |, |>>|, |<<|, etc.
 	When zero the `'ts'`  value will be used.  Use the |shiftwidth()|
 	function to get the effective shiftwidth value.

## swapfile


```lua
boolean
```

 `'swapfile'`  `'swf'` 	boolean (default on)
 			local to buffer
 	Use a swapfile for the buffer.  This option can be reset when a
 	swapfile is not wanted for a specific buffer.  For example, with
 	confidential information that even root must not be able to access.
 	Careful: All text will be in memory:
 		- Don't use this for big files.
 		- Recovery will be impossible!
 	A swapfile will only be present when |`'updatecount'` | is non-zero and
 	`'swapfile'`  is set.
 	When `'swapfile'`  is reset, the swap file for the current buffer is
 	immediately deleted.  When `'swapfile'`  is set, and `'updatecount'`  is
 	non-zero, a swap file is immediately created.
 	Also see |swap-file|.
 	If you want to open a new buffer without creating a swap file for it,
 	use the |:noswapfile| modifier.
 	See `'directory'`  for where the swap file is created.
 
 	This option is used together with `'bufhidden'`  and `'buftype'`  to
 	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

## swb


```lua
vim.opt.switchbuf
```

 `'switchbuf'`  `'swb'` 	string	(default "uselast")
 			global
 	This option controls the behavior when switching between buffers.
 	Mostly for |quickfix| commands some values are also used for other
 	commands, as mentioned below.
 	Possible values (comma-separated list):
 	   useopen	If included, jump to the first open window that
 			contains the specified buffer (if there is one).
 			Otherwise: Do not examine other windows.
 			This setting is checked with |quickfix| commands, when
 			jumping to errors (":cc", ":cn", "cp", etc.).  It is
 			also used in all buffer related split commands, for
 			example ":sbuffer", ":sbnext", or ":sbrewind".
 	   usetab	Like "useopen", but also consider windows in other tab
 			pages.
 	   split	If included, split the current window before loading
 			a buffer for a |quickfix| command that display errors.
 			Otherwise: do not split, use current window (when used
 			in the quickfix window: the previously used window or
 			split if there is no other window).
 	   vsplit	Just like "split" but split vertically.
 	   newtab	Like "split", but open a new tab page.  Overrules
 			"split" when both are present.
 	   uselast	If included, jump to the previously used window when
 			jumping to errors with |quickfix| commands.

## swf


```lua
vim.opt.swapfile

 `'swapfile'`  `'swf'` 	boolean (default on)
 			local to buffer
 	Use a swapfile for the buffer.  This option can be reset when a
 	swapfile is not wanted for a specific buffer.  For example, with
 	confidential information that even root must not be able to access.

## switchbuf


```lua

## sxe


```lua
vim.opt.shellxescape
```

 `'shellxescape'`  `'sxe'` 	string	(default: "")
 			global
 	When `'shellxquote'`  is set to "(" then the characters listed in this
 	option will be escaped with a `'^'`  character.  This makes it possible
 	to execute most external commands with cmd.exe.

## sxq


```lua
vim.opt.shellxquote
```

 `'shellxquote'`  `'sxq'` 	string	(default: "", Windows: "\"")
 			global
 	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
 	the "!" and ":!" commands.  Includes the redirection.  See
 	`'shellquote'`  to exclude the redirection.  It's probably not useful
 	to set both options.
 	When the value is `'('`  then `')'`  is appended. When the value is `'"('` 
 	then `')"'`  is appended.
 	When the value is `'('`  then also see `'shellxescape'` .
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## syn


```lua
vim.opt.syntax
```

 `'syntax'`  `'syn'` 		string	(default empty)
 			local to buffer
 	When this option is set, the syntax with this name is loaded, unless
 	syntax highlighting has been switched off with ":syntax off".
 	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current syntax (the
 	b:current_syntax variable does).
 	This option is most useful in a modeline, for a file which syntax is
 	not automatically recognized.  Example, in an IDL file: >
 		/* vim: set syntax=idl : */
 <	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
 	names.  Example: >
 		/* vim: set syntax=c.doxygen : */
 <	This will use the "c" syntax first, then the "doxygen" syntax.
 	Note that the second one must be prepared to be loaded as an addition,
 	otherwise it will be skipped.  More than one dot may appear.
 	To switch off syntax highlighting for the current file, use: >
 		:set syntax=OFF
 <	To switch syntax highlighting on according to the current value of the
 	`'filetype'`  option: >
 		:set syntax=ON
 <	What actually happens when setting the `'syntax'`  option is that the
 	Syntax autocommand event is triggered with the value as argument.
 	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the `'s'`  or
 	`'S'`  flag in `'cpoptions'` .
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

## synmaxcol


```lua
integer
```

 `'synmaxcol'`  `'smc'` 	number	(default 3000)
 			local to buffer
 	Maximum column in which to search for syntax items.  In long lines the
 	text after this column is not highlighted and following lines may not
 	be highlighted correctly, because the syntax state is cleared.
 	This helps to avoid very slow redrawing for an XML file that is one
 	long line.
 	Set to zero to remove the limit.

## syntax


```lua
string
```

 `'syntax'`  `'syn'` 		string	(default empty)
 			local to buffer
 	When this option is set, the syntax with this name is loaded, unless
 	syntax highlighting has been switched off with ":syntax off".
 	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current syntax (the
 	b:current_syntax variable does).
 	This option is most useful in a modeline, for a file which syntax is

 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

## tabline


```lua
string
```

 `'tabline'`  `'tal'` 		string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the tab pages
 	line at the top of the Vim window.  When empty Vim will use a default
 	tab pages line.  See |setting-tabline| for more info.
 
 	The tab pages line only appears as specified with the `'showtabline'` 
 	option and only when there is no GUI tab line.  When `'e'`  is in
 	`'guioptions'`  and the GUI supports a tab line `'guitablabel'`  is used
 	instead.  Note that the two tab pages lines are very different.
 
 	The value is evaluated like with `'statusline'` .  You can use
 	|tabpagenr()|, |tabpagewinnr()| and |tabpagebuflist()| to figure out
 	the text to be displayed.  Use "%1T" for the first label, "%2T" for
 	the second one, etc.  Use "%X" items for closing labels.
 
 	When changing something that is used in `'tabline'`  that does not
 	trigger it to be updated, use |:redrawtabline|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	Keep in mind that only one of the tab pages is the current one, others
 	are invisible and you can't jump to their windows.

## tabpagemax


```lua
integer
```

 `'tabpagemax'`  `'tpm'` 	number	(default 50)
 			global
 	Maximum number of tab pages to be opened by the |-p| command line
 	argument or the ":tab all" command. |tabpage|

## tabstop


```lua
integer
```

 `'tabstop'`  `'ts'` 		number	(default 8)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
 	the |:retab| command, and the `'softtabstop'`  option.
 
 	Note: Setting `'tabstop'`  to any other value than 8 can make your file
 	appear wrong in many places.
 	The value must be more than 0 and less than 10000.
 
 	There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
 	1. Always keep `'tabstop'`  at 8, set `'softtabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to 4
 	   (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use `'noexpandtab'` .  Then Vim
 	   will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
 	   behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
 	2. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use
 	   `'expandtab'` .  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
 	   formatting will never be messed up when `'tabstop'`  is changed.
 	3. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use a
 	   |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
 	   works when using Vim to edit the file.
 	4. Always set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to the same value, and
 	   `'noexpandtab'` .  This should then work (for initial indents only)
 	   for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
 	   tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
 	   though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when `'tabstop'`  is
 	   changed.
 
 	The value of `'tabstop'`  will be ignored if |`'vartabstop'` | is set to
 	anything other than an empty string.

## tag


```lua
vim.opt.tags
```

 `'tags'`  `'tag'` 		string	(default "./tags;,tags")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Filenames for the tag command, separated by spaces or commas.  To
 	include a space or comma in a file name, precede it with a backslash
 	(see |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes).
 	When a file name starts with "./", the `'.'`  is replaced with the path
 	of the current file.  But only when the `'d'`  flag is not included in
 	`'cpoptions'` .  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  Also see
 	|tags-option|.
 	"*", "" and other wildcards can be used to search for tags files in
 	a directory tree.  See |file-searching|.  E.g., "/lib//tags" will
 	find all files named "tags" below "/lib".  The filename itself cannot
 	contain wildcards, it is used as-is.  E.g., "/lib//tags?" will find
 	files called "tags?".
 	The |tagfiles()| function can be used to get a list of the file names
 	actually used.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	file names from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.

## tagbsearch


```lua
boolean
```

 `'tagbsearch'`  `'tbs'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When searching for a tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command), Vim can either
 	use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
 	searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
 	will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
 	Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
 	they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
 	`'tagbsearch'`  option need to be switched off.
 
 	When `'tagbsearch'`  is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
 	files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
 	certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
 	`'tagbsearch'`  is off, only a linear search is done.
 
 	Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
 	at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted: >
    !_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/some comment/
 <	[The whitespace before and after the `'0'`  must be a single <Tab>]
 
 	When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
 	files listed in `'tags'` , and case is ignored or a pattern is used
 	instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
 	Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
 	be found in the retry.
 
 	If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
 	linear search can be avoided when case is ignored.  Use a value of `'2'` 
 	in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be case-fold
 	sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in the command:
 	"sort -f -o tags tags".  For Universal ctags and Exuberant ctags
 	version 5.x or higher (at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be
 	used for this as well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for
 	this to work.
 
 	By default, tag searches are case-sensitive.  Case is ignored when
 	`'ignorecase'`  is set and `'tagcase'`  is "followic", or when `'tagcase'`  is
 	"ignore".
 	Also when `'tagcase'`  is "followscs" and `'smartcase'`  is set, or
 	`'tagcase'`  is "smart", and the pattern contains only lowercase
 	characters.
 
 	When `'tagbsearch'`  is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
 	exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
 	files may only be found with `'tagbsearch'`  off.
 	When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
 	ASCII byte value), `'tagbsearch'`  should be off, or the line given above
 	must be included in the tags file.
 	This option doesn't affect commands that find all matching tags (e.g.,
 	command-line completion and ":help").

## tagcase


```lua
string
```

 `'tagcase'`  `'tc'` 		string	(default "followic")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	This option specifies how case is handled when searching the tags
 	file:
 	   followic	Follow the `'ignorecase'`  option
 	   followscs    Follow the `'smartcase'`  and `'ignorecase'`  options
 	   ignore	Ignore case
 	   match	Match case
 	   smart	Ignore case unless an upper case letter is used

## tagfunc


```lua
string
```

 `'tagfunc'`  `'tfu'` 		string	(default: empty)
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies a function to be used to perform tag searches.
 	The function gets the tag pattern and should return a List of matching
 	tags.  See |tag-function| for an explanation of how to write the
 	function and an example.  The value can be the name of a function, a
 	|lambda| or a |Funcref|. See |option-value-function| for more
 	information.

## taglength


```lua
integer
```

 `'taglength'`  `'tl'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 	If non-zero, tags are significant up to this number of characters.

## tagrelative


```lua
boolean
```

 `'tagrelative'`  `'tr'` 	boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	If on and using a tags file in another directory, file names in that
 	tags file are relative to the directory where the tags file is.

## tags


```lua
string
```

 `'tags'`  `'tag'` 		string	(default "./tags;,tags")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Filenames for the tag command, separated by spaces or commas.  To
 	include a space or comma in a file name, precede it with a backslash
 	(see |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes).
 	When a file name starts with "./", the `'.'`  is replaced with the path
 	of the current file.  But only when the `'d'`  flag is not included in
 	`'cpoptions'` .  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  Also see
 	|tags-option|.
 	"*", "" and other wildcards can be used to search for tags files in
 	a directory tree.  See |file-searching|.  E.g., "/lib//tags" will
 	find all files named "tags" below "/lib".  The filename itself cannot
 	contain wildcards, it is used as-is.  E.g., "/lib//tags?" will find
 	files called "tags?".
 	The |tagfiles()| function can be used to get a list of the file names
 	actually used.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	file names from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.

## tagstack


```lua
boolean
```

 `'tagstack'`  `'tgst'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, the |tagstack| is used normally.  When off, a ":tag" or
 	":tselect" command with an argument will not push the tag onto the
 	tagstack.  A following ":tag" without an argument, a ":pop" command or
 	any other command that uses the tagstack will use the unmodified
 	tagstack, but does change the pointer to the active entry.
 	Resetting this option is useful when using a ":tag" command in a
 	mapping which should not change the tagstack.

## tal


```lua
vim.opt.tabline
```

 `'tabline'`  `'tal'` 		string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the tab pages
 	line at the top of the Vim window.  When empty Vim will use a default
 	tab pages line.  See |setting-tabline| for more info.
 
 	The tab pages line only appears as specified with the `'showtabline'` 
 	option and only when there is no GUI tab line.  When `'e'`  is in
 	`'guioptions'`  and the GUI supports a tab line `'guitablabel'`  is used
 	instead.  Note that the two tab pages lines are very different.
 
 	The value is evaluated like with `'statusline'` .  You can use
 	|tabpagenr()|, |tabpagewinnr()| and |tabpagebuflist()| to figure out
 	the text to be displayed.  Use "%1T" for the first label, "%2T" for
 	the second one, etc.  Use "%X" items for closing labels.
 
 	When changing something that is used in `'tabline'`  that does not
 	trigger it to be updated, use |:redrawtabline|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	Keep in mind that only one of the tab pages is the current one, others
 	are invisible and you can't jump to their windows.

## tbidi


```lua
vim.opt.termbidi
```

 `'termbidi'`  `'tbidi'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	The terminal is in charge of Bi-directionality of text (as specified
 	by Unicode).  The terminal is also expected to do the required shaping
 	that some languages (such as Arabic) require.
 	Setting this option implies that `'rightleft'`  will not be set when
 	`'arabic'`  is set and the value of `'arabicshape'`  will be ignored.
 	Note that setting `'termbidi'`  has the immediate effect that
 	`'arabicshape'`  is ignored, but `'rightleft'`  isn't changed automatically.
 	For further details see |arabic.txt|.

## tbs


```lua
vim.opt.tagbsearch
```

 `'tagbsearch'`  `'tbs'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When searching for a tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command), Vim can either
 	use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
 	searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
 	will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
 	Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
 	they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
 	`'tagbsearch'`  option need to be switched off.
 
 	When `'tagbsearch'`  is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
 	files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
 	certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
 	`'tagbsearch'`  is off, only a linear search is done.
 
 	Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
 	at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted: >
    !_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/some comment/
 <	[The whitespace before and after the `'0'`  must be a single <Tab>]
 
 	When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
 	files listed in `'tags'` , and case is ignored or a pattern is used
 	instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
 	Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
 	be found in the retry.
 
 	If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
 	linear search can be avoided when case is ignored.  Use a value of `'2'` 
 	in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be case-fold
 	sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in the command:
 	"sort -f -o tags tags".  For Universal ctags and Exuberant ctags
 	version 5.x or higher (at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be
 	used for this as well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for
 	this to work.
 
 	By default, tag searches are case-sensitive.  Case is ignored when
 	`'ignorecase'`  is set and `'tagcase'`  is "followic", or when `'tagcase'`  is
 	"ignore".
 	Also when `'tagcase'`  is "followscs" and `'smartcase'`  is set, or
 	`'tagcase'`  is "smart", and the pattern contains only lowercase
 	characters.
 
 	When `'tagbsearch'`  is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
 	exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
 	files may only be found with `'tagbsearch'`  off.
 	When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
 	ASCII byte value), `'tagbsearch'`  should be off, or the line given above
 	must be included in the tags file.
 	This option doesn't affect commands that find all matching tags (e.g.,
 	command-line completion and ":help").

## tc


```lua
vim.opt.tagcase
```

 `'tagcase'`  `'tc'` 		string	(default "followic")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	This option specifies how case is handled when searching the tags
 	file:
 	   followic	Follow the `'ignorecase'`  option
 	   followscs    Follow the `'smartcase'`  and `'ignorecase'`  options
 	   ignore	Ignore case
 	   match	Match case
 	   smart	Ignore case unless an upper case letter is used

## tenc


```lua
vim.opt.termencoding
```

## termbidi


```lua
boolean
```

 `'termbidi'`  `'tbidi'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	The terminal is in charge of Bi-directionality of text (as specified
 	by Unicode).  The terminal is also expected to do the required shaping
 	that some languages (such as Arabic) require.
 	Setting this option implies that `'rightleft'`  will not be set when
 	`'arabic'`  is set and the value of `'arabicshape'`  will be ignored.
 	Note that setting `'termbidi'`  has the immediate effect that
 	`'arabicshape'`  is ignored, but `'rightleft'`  isn't changed automatically.
 	For further details see |arabic.txt|.

## termencoding


```lua
string

## termguicolors


```lua
boolean
```

 `'termguicolors'`  `'tgc'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	Enables 24-bit RGB color in the |TUI|.  Uses "gui" |:highlight|
 	attributes instead of "cterm" attributes. |guifg|
 	Requires an ISO-8613-3 compatible terminal.

## termpastefilter


```lua
string
```

 `'termpastefilter'`  `'tpf'` 	string	(default: "BS,HT,ESC,DEL")
 			global
 	A comma-separated list of options for specifying control characters
 	to be removed from the text pasted into the terminal window. The
 	supported values are:
 
 	   BS	    Backspace
 
 	   HT	    TAB
 
 	   FF	    Form feed
 
 	   ESC	    Escape
 
 	   DEL	    DEL
 
 	   C0	    Other control characters, excluding Line feed and
 		    Carriage return < ' '
 
 	   C1	    Control characters 0x80...0x9F

## terse


```lua
boolean
```

## textwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'textwidth'`  `'tw'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Maximum width of text that is being inserted.  A longer line will be
 	broken after white space to get this width.  A zero value disables
 	this.
 	When `'textwidth'`  is zero, `'wrapmargin'`  may be used.  See also
 	`'formatoptions'`  and |ins-textwidth|.
 	When `'formatexpr'`  is set it will be used to break the line.

## tf


```lua
vim.opt.ttyfast
```

## tfu


```lua
vim.opt.tagfunc
```

 `'tagfunc'`  `'tfu'` 		string	(default: empty)
 			local to buffer
 	This option specifies a function to be used to perform tag searches.
 	The function gets the tag pattern and should return a List of matching
 	tags.  See |tag-function| for an explanation of how to write the
 	function and an example.  The value can be the name of a function, a
 	|lambda| or a |Funcref|. See |option-value-function| for more
 	information.

## tgc


```lua
vim.opt.termguicolors

 `'termguicolors'`  `'tgc'` 	boolean (default off)
 			global
 	Enables 24-bit RGB color in the |TUI|.  Uses "gui" |:highlight|
 	attributes instead of "cterm" attributes. |guifg|
 	Requires an ISO-8613-3 compatible terminal.

## tgst


```lua
vim.opt.tagstack
```

 `'tagstack'`  `'tgst'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When on, the |tagstack| is used normally.  When off, a ":tag" or
 	":tselect" command with an argument will not push the tag onto the
 	tagstack.  A following ":tag" without an argument, a ":pop" command or
 	any other command that uses the tagstack will use the unmodified
 	tagstack, but does change the pointer to the active entry.
 	Resetting this option is useful when using a ":tag" command in a
 	mapping which should not change the tagstack.

## thesaurus


```lua
string
```

 `'thesaurus'`  `'tsr'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
 	for thesaurus completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.  See
 	|compl-thesaurus|.
 
 	This option is not used if `'thesaurusfunc'`  is set, either for the
 	buffer or globally.
 
 	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
 	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
 	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.  The use of
 	|:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing directories
 	from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version uses
 	another default.  Backticks cannot be used in this option for security
 	reasons.

## thesaurusfunc


```lua
string
```

 `'thesaurusfunc'`  `'tsrfu'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	This option specifies a function to be used for thesaurus completion
 	with CTRL-X CTRL-T. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T| See |compl-thesaurusfunc|.
 	The value can be the name of a function, a |lambda| or a |Funcref|.
 	See |option-value-function| for more information.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## tildeop


```lua
boolean
```

 `'tildeop'`  `'top'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on: The tilde command "~" behaves like an operator.

## timeout


```lua
boolean
```

 `'timeout'`  `'to'` 		boolean (default on)
 			global
 	This option and `'timeoutlen'`  determine the behavior when part of a
 	mapped key sequence has been received. For example, if <c-f> is
 	pressed and `'timeout'`  is set, Nvim will wait `'timeoutlen'`  milliseconds
 	for any key that can follow <c-f> in a mapping.

## timeoutlen


```lua
integer
```

 `'timeoutlen'`  `'tm'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global
 	Time in milliseconds to wait for a mapped sequence to complete.

## title


```lua
boolean
```

 `'title'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When on, the title of the window will be set to the value of
 	`'titlestring'`  (if it is not empty), or to:
 		filename [+=-] (path) - NVIM
 	Where:
 		filename	the name of the file being edited
 		-		indicates the file cannot be modified, `'ma'`  off
 		+		indicates the file was modified
 		=		indicates the file is read-only
 		=+		indicates the file is read-only and modified
 		(path)		is the path of the file being edited
 		- NVIM		the server name |v:servername| or "NVIM"

## titlelen


```lua
integer
```

 `'titlelen'` 		number	(default 85)
 			global
 	Gives the percentage of `'columns'`  to use for the length of the window
 	title.  When the title is longer, only the end of the path name is
 	shown.  A `'<'`  character before the path name is used to indicate this.
 	Using a percentage makes this adapt to the width of the window.  But
 	it won't work perfectly, because the actual number of characters
 	available also depends on the font used and other things in the title
 	bar.  When `'titlelen'`  is zero the full path is used.  Otherwise,
 	values from 1 to 30000 percent can be used.
 	`'titlelen'`  is also used for the `'titlestring'`  option.

## titleold


```lua
string
```

 `'titleold'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	If not empty, this option will be used to set the window title when
 	exiting.  Only if `'title'`  is enabled.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## titlestring


```lua
string
```

 `'titlestring'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the title of the
 	window.  This happens only when the `'title'`  option is on.
 
 	When this option contains printf-style `'%'`  items, they will be
 	expanded according to the rules used for `'statusline'` .
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	Example: >
 	    :auto BufEnter * let &titlestring = hostname() .. "/" .. expand("%:p")
 	    :set title titlestring=%<%F%=%l/%L-%P titlelen=70
 <	The value of `'titlelen'`  is used to align items in the middle or right
 	of the available space.
 	Some people prefer to have the file name first: >
 	    :set titlestring=%t%(\ %M%)%(\ (%{expand(\"%:~:.:h\")})%)%(\ %a%)
 <	Note the use of "%{ }" and an expression to get the path of the file,
 	without the file name.  The "%( %)" constructs are used to add a
 	separating space only when needed.
 	NOTE: Use of special characters in `'titlestring'`  may cause the display
 	to be garbled (e.g., when it contains a CR or NL character).

## tl


```lua
vim.opt.taglength
```

 `'taglength'`  `'tl'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global
 	If non-zero, tags are significant up to this number of characters.

## tm


```lua
vim.opt.timeoutlen

## to


```lua
vim.opt.timeout

 `'timeout'`  `'to'` 		boolean (default on)
 			global
 	This option and `'timeoutlen'`  determine the behavior when part of a
 	mapped key sequence has been received. For example, if <c-f> is
 	pressed and `'timeout'`  is set, Nvim will wait `'timeoutlen'`  milliseconds

## tpf


```lua
vim.opt.termpastefilter
```

 `'termpastefilter'`  `'tpf'` 	string	(default: "BS,HT,ESC,DEL")
 			global
 	A comma-separated list of options for specifying control characters
 	to be removed from the text pasted into the terminal window. The
 	supported values are:
 
 	   BS	    Backspace
 
 	   HT	    TAB
 
 	   FF	    Form feed
 
 	   ESC	    Escape
 
 	   DEL	    DEL
 
 	   C0	    Other control characters, excluding Line feed and
 		    Carriage return < ' '
 
 	   C1	    Control characters 0x80...0x9F

## tpm


```lua
vim.opt.tabpagemax
```

 `'tabpagemax'`  `'tpm'` 	number	(default 50)
 			global
 	Maximum number of tab pages to be opened by the |-p| command line
 	argument or the ":tab all" command. |tabpage|

## tr


```lua
vim.opt.tagrelative
```

 `'tagrelative'`  `'tr'` 	boolean	(default: on)
 			global
 	If on and using a tags file in another directory, file names in that
 	tags file are relative to the directory where the tags file is.

## ts


```lua
vim.opt.tabstop
```

 `'tabstop'`  `'ts'` 		number	(default 8)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
 	the |:retab| command, and the `'softtabstop'`  option.
 
 	Note: Setting `'tabstop'`  to any other value than 8 can make your file
 	appear wrong in many places.
 	The value must be more than 0 and less than 10000.
 
 	There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
 	1. Always keep `'tabstop'`  at 8, set `'softtabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to 4
 	   (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use `'noexpandtab'` .  Then Vim
 	   will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
 	   behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
 	2. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use
 	   `'expandtab'` .  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
 	   formatting will never be messed up when `'tabstop'`  is changed.
 	3. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use a
 	   |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
 	   works when using Vim to edit the file.
 	4. Always set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to the same value, and
 	   `'noexpandtab'` .  This should then work (for initial indents only)
 	   for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
 	   tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
 	   though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when `'tabstop'`  is
 	   changed.
 
 	The value of `'tabstop'`  will be ignored if |`'vartabstop'` | is set to
 	anything other than an empty string.

## tsr


```lua
vim.opt.thesaurus
```

 `'thesaurus'`  `'tsr'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
 	for thesaurus completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.  See
 	|compl-thesaurus|.
 
 	This option is not used if `'thesaurusfunc'`  is set, either for the
 	buffer or globally.
 
 	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
 	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
 	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.  The use of
 	|:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing directories
 	from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version uses
 	another default.  Backticks cannot be used in this option for security
 	reasons.

## tsrfu


```lua
vim.opt.thesaurusfunc
```

 `'thesaurusfunc'`  `'tsrfu'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	This option specifies a function to be used for thesaurus completion
 	with CTRL-X CTRL-T. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T| See |compl-thesaurusfunc|.
 	The value can be the name of a function, a |lambda| or a |Funcref|.
 	See |option-value-function| for more information.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## ttimeout


```lua
boolean
```

 `'ttimeout'` 		boolean (default on)
 			global
 	This option and `'ttimeoutlen'`  determine the behavior when part of a
 	key code sequence has been received by the |TUI|.
 
 	For example if <Esc> (the \x1b byte) is received and `'ttimeout'`  is
 	set, Nvim waits `'ttimeoutlen'`  milliseconds for the terminal to
 	complete a key code sequence. If no input arrives before the timeout,
 	a single <Esc> is assumed. Many TUI cursor key codes start with <Esc>.
 
 	On very slow systems this may fail, causing cursor keys not to work
 	sometimes.  If you discover this problem you can ":set ttimeoutlen=9999".
 	Nvim will wait for the next character to arrive after an <Esc>.

## ttimeoutlen


```lua
integer
```

 `'ttimeoutlen'`  `'ttm'` 	number	(default 50)
 			global
 	Time in milliseconds to wait for a key code sequence to complete. Also
 	used for CTRL-\ CTRL-N and CTRL-\ CTRL-G when part of a command has
 	been typed.

## ttm


```lua
vim.opt.ttimeoutlen
```

 `'ttimeoutlen'`  `'ttm'` 	number	(default 50)
 			global
 	Time in milliseconds to wait for a key code sequence to complete. Also
 	used for CTRL-\ CTRL-N and CTRL-\ CTRL-G when part of a command has
 	been typed.

## ttyfast


```lua
boolean
```

## tw


```lua
vim.opt.textwidth
```

 `'textwidth'`  `'tw'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Maximum width of text that is being inserted.  A longer line will be
 	broken after white space to get this width.  A zero value disables
 	this.
 	When `'textwidth'`  is zero, `'wrapmargin'`  may be used.  See also
 	`'formatoptions'`  and |ins-textwidth|.
 	When `'formatexpr'`  is set it will be used to break the line.

## uc


```lua
vim.opt.updatecount
```

 `'updatecount'`  `'uc'` 	number	(default: 200)
 			global
 	After typing this many characters the swap file will be written to
 	disk.  When zero, no swap file will be created at all (see chapter on
 	recovery |crash-recovery|).  `'updatecount'`  is set to zero by starting
 	Vim with the "-n" option, see |startup|.  When editing in readonly
 	mode this option will be initialized to 10000.
 	The swapfile can be disabled per buffer with |`'swapfile'` |.
 	When `'updatecount'`  is set from zero to non-zero, swap files are
 	created for all buffers that have `'swapfile'`  set.  When `'updatecount'` 
 	is set to zero, existing swap files are not deleted.
 	This option has no meaning in buffers where |`'buftype'` | is "nofile"
 	or "nowrite".

## udf


```lua
vim.opt.undofile
```

 `'undofile'`  `'udf'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When on, Vim automatically saves undo history to an undo file when
 	writing a buffer to a file, and restores undo history from the same
 	file on buffer read.
 	The directory where the undo file is stored is specified by `'undodir'` .
 	For more information about this feature see |undo-persistence|.
 	The undo file is not read when `'undoreload'`  causes the buffer from
 	before a reload to be saved for undo.
 	When `'undofile'`  is turned off the undo file is NOT deleted.

## udir


```lua
vim.opt.undodir
```

 `'undodir'`  `'udir'` 	string	(default "$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/undo//")
 			global
 	List of directory names for undo files, separated with commas.
 	See `'backupdir'`  for details of the format.
 	"." means using the directory of the file.  The undo file name for
 	"file.txt" is ".file.txt.un~".
 	For other directories the file name is the full path of the edited
 	file, with path separators replaced with "%".
 	When writing: The first directory that exists is used.  "." always
 	works, no directories after "." will be used for writing.  If none of
 	the directories exist Nvim will attempt to create the last directory in
 	the list.
 	When reading all entries are tried to find an undo file.  The first
 	undo file that exists is used.  When it cannot be read an error is
 	given, no further entry is used.
 	See |undo-persistence|.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.
 
 	Note that unlike `'directory'`  and `'backupdir'` , `'undodir'`  always acts as
 	though the trailing slashes are present (see `'backupdir'`  for what this
 	means).

## ul


```lua
vim.opt.undolevels
```

 `'undolevels'`  `'ul'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Maximum number of changes that can be undone.  Since undo information
 	is kept in memory, higher numbers will cause more memory to be used.
 	Nevertheless, a single change can already use a large amount of memory.
 	Set to 0 for Vi compatibility: One level of undo and "u" undoes
 	itself: >
 		set ul=0
 <	But you can also get Vi compatibility by including the `'u'`  flag in
 	`'cpoptions'` , and still be able to use CTRL-R to repeat undo.
 	Also see |undo-two-ways|.
 	Set to -1 for no undo at all.  You might want to do this only for the
 	current buffer: >
 		setlocal ul=-1
 <	This helps when you run out of memory for a single change.
 
 	The local value is set to -123456 when the global value is to be used.
 
 	Also see |clear-undo|.

## undodir


```lua

## undofile


```lua
boolean
```

 `'undofile'`  `'udf'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When on, Vim automatically saves undo history to an undo file when
 	writing a buffer to a file, and restores undo history from the same
 	file on buffer read.
 	The directory where the undo file is stored is specified by `'undodir'` .
 	For more information about this feature see |undo-persistence|.
 	The undo file is not read when `'undoreload'`  causes the buffer from
 	before a reload to be saved for undo.
 	When `'undofile'`  is turned off the undo file is NOT deleted.

## undolevels


```lua
integer
```

 `'undolevels'`  `'ul'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Maximum number of changes that can be undone.  Since undo information
 	is kept in memory, higher numbers will cause more memory to be used.

## undoreload


```lua
integer
```

 `'undoreload'`  `'ur'` 	number	(default 10000)
 			global
 	Save the whole buffer for undo when reloading it.  This applies to the
 	":e!" command and reloading for when the buffer changed outside of
 	Vim. |FileChangedShell|
 	The save only happens when this option is negative or when the number
 	of lines is smaller than the value of this option.
 	Set this option to zero to disable undo for a reload.
 
 	When saving undo for a reload, any undo file is not read.
 
 	Note that this causes the whole buffer to be stored in memory.  Set
 	this option to a lower value if you run out of memory.

## updatecount


```lua
integer
```

 `'updatecount'`  `'uc'` 	number	(default: 200)
 			global
 	After typing this many characters the swap file will be written to
 	disk.  When zero, no swap file will be created at all (see chapter on
 	recovery |crash-recovery|).  `'updatecount'`  is set to zero by starting
 	Vim with the "-n" option, see |startup|.  When editing in readonly
 	mode this option will be initialized to 10000.
 	The swapfile can be disabled per buffer with |`'swapfile'` |.
 	When `'updatecount'`  is set from zero to non-zero, swap files are
 	created for all buffers that have `'swapfile'`  set.  When `'updatecount'` 
 	is set to zero, existing swap files are not deleted.
 	This option has no meaning in buffers where |`'buftype'` | is "nofile"
 	or "nowrite".

## updatetime


```lua
integer
```

 `'updatetime'`  `'ut'` 	number	(default 4000)
 			global
 	If this many milliseconds nothing is typed the swap file will be
 	written to disk (see |crash-recovery|).  Also used for the
 	|CursorHold| autocommand event.

## ur


```lua
vim.opt.undoreload
```

 `'undoreload'`  `'ur'` 	number	(default 10000)
 			global
 	Save the whole buffer for undo when reloading it.  This applies to the
 	":e!" command and reloading for when the buffer changed outside of
 	Vim. |FileChangedShell|
 	The save only happens when this option is negative or when the number
 	of lines is smaller than the value of this option.
 	Set this option to zero to disable undo for a reload.
 
 	When saving undo for a reload, any undo file is not read.
 
 	Note that this causes the whole buffer to be stored in memory.  Set
 	this option to a lower value if you run out of memory.

## ut


```lua
vim.opt.updatetime
```

 `'updatetime'`  `'ut'` 	number	(default 4000)
 			global
 	If this many milliseconds nothing is typed the swap file will be
 	written to disk (see |crash-recovery|).  Also used for the
 	|CursorHold| autocommand event.

## varsofttabstop


```lua
string
```

 `'varsofttabstop'`  `'vsts'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	A list of the number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while editing,
 	such as inserting a <Tab> or using <BS>.  It "feels" like variable-
 	width <Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mixture of spaces
 	and <Tab>s is used.  Tab widths are separated with commas, with the
 	final value applying to all subsequent tabs.
 
 	For example, when editing assembly language files where statements
 	start in the 9th column and comments in the 41st, it may be useful
 	to use the following: >
 		:set varsofttabstop=8,32,8
 <	This will set soft tabstops with 8 and 8 + 32 spaces, and 8 more
 	for every column thereafter.
 
 	Note that the value of |`'softtabstop'` | will be ignored while
 	`'varsofttabstop'`  is set.

## vartabstop


```lua
string
```

 `'vartabstop'`  `'vts'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	A list of the number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for,
 	separated by commas.  Each value corresponds to one tab, with the
 	final value applying to all subsequent tabs. For example: >
 		:set vartabstop=4,20,10,8
 <	This will make the first tab 4 spaces wide, the second 20 spaces,
 	the third 10 spaces, and all following tabs 8 spaces.
 
 	Note that the value of |`'tabstop'` | will be ignored while `'vartabstop'` 
 	is set.

## vb


```lua
vim.opt.visualbell
```

 `'visualbell'`  `'vb'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Use visual bell instead of beeping.  Also see `'errorbells'` .

## vbs


```lua
vim.opt.verbose
```

 `'verbose'`  `'vbs'` 		number	(default 0)
 			global
 	Sets the verbosity level.  Also set by |-V| and |:verbose|.
 
 	Tracing of options in Lua scripts is activated at level 1; Lua scripts
 	are not traced with verbose=0, for performance.
 
 	If greater than or equal to a given level, Nvim produces the following
 	messages:
 
 	Level   Messages ~
 	----------------------------------------------------------------------
 	1	Lua assignments to options, mappings, etc.
 	2	When a file is ":source"'ed, or |shada| file is read or written.
 	3	UI info, terminal capabilities.
 	4	Shell commands.
 	5	Every searched tags file and include file.
 	8	Files for which a group of autocommands is executed.
 	9	Executed autocommands.
 	11	Finding items in a path.
 	12	Vimscript function calls.
 	13	When an exception is thrown, caught, finished, or discarded.
 	14	Anything pending in a ":finally" clause.
 	15	Ex commands from a script (truncated at 200 characters).
 	16	Ex commands.
 
 	If `'verbosefile'`  is set then the verbose messages are not displayed.

## vdir


```lua
vim.opt.viewdir
```

 `'viewdir'`  `'vdir'` 	string	(default: "$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/view//")
 			global
 	Name of the directory where to store files for |:mkview|.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

## ve


```lua
vim.opt.virtualedit
```

 `'virtualedit'`  `'ve'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	A comma-separated list of these words:
 	    block	Allow virtual editing in Visual block mode.
 	    insert	Allow virtual editing in Insert mode.
 	    all		Allow virtual editing in all modes.
 	    onemore	Allow the cursor to move just past the end of the line
 	    none	When used as the local value, do not allow virtual
 			editing even when the global value is set.  When used
 			as the global value, "none" is the same as "".
 	    NONE	Alternative spelling of "none".
 
 	Virtual editing means that the cursor can be positioned where there is
 	no actual character.  This can be halfway into a tab or beyond the end
 	of the line.  Useful for selecting a rectangle in Visual mode and
 	editing a table.
 	"onemore" is not the same, it will only allow moving the cursor just
 	after the last character of the line.  This makes some commands more
 	consistent.  Previously the cursor was always past the end of the line
 	if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi compatible.  It may also
 	break some plugins or Vim scripts.  For example because |l| can move
 	the cursor after the last character.  Use with care!
 	Using the `$` command will move to the last character in the line, not
 	past it.  This may actually move the cursor to the left!
 	The `g$` command will move to the end of the screen line.
 	It doesn't make sense to combine "all" with "onemore", but you will
 	not get a warning for it.
 	When combined with other words, "none" is ignored.

## verbose


```lua
integer
```

 `'verbose'`  `'vbs'` 		number	(default 0)
 			global
 	Sets the verbosity level.  Also set by |-V| and |:verbose|.
 
 	Tracing of options in Lua scripts is activated at level 1; Lua scripts

## verbosefile


```lua
string
```

 `'verbosefile'`  `'vfile'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When not empty all messages are written in a file with this name.
 	When the file exists messages are appended.
 	Writing to the file ends when Vim exits or when `'verbosefile'`  is made
 	empty.  Writes are buffered, thus may not show up for some time.
 	Setting `'verbosefile'`  to a new value is like making it empty first.
 	The difference with |:redir| is that verbose messages are not
 	displayed when `'verbosefile'`  is set.

## vfile


```lua
vim.opt.verbosefile
```

 `'verbosefile'`  `'vfile'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When not empty all messages are written in a file with this name.
 	When the file exists messages are appended.
 	Writing to the file ends when Vim exits or when `'verbosefile'`  is made
 	empty.  Writes are buffered, thus may not show up for some time.

 	security reasons.

## viewoptions


```lua
string

 `'viewoptions'`  `'vop'` 	string	(default: "folds,cursor,curdir")
 			global
 	Changes the effect of the |:mkview| command.  It is a comma-separated
 	list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring something:
 	   word		save and restore ~

## wak


```lua
vim.opt.winaltkeys
```

 `'winaltkeys'`  `'wak'` 	string	(default "menu")
 			global
 			{only used in Win32}
 	Some GUI versions allow the access to menu entries by using the ALT
 	key in combination with a character that appears underlined in the
 	menu.  This conflicts with the use of the ALT key for mappings and
 	entering special characters.  This option tells what to do:
 	  no	Don't use ALT keys for menus.  ALT key combinations can be
 		mapped, but there is no automatic handling.
 	  yes	ALT key handling is done by the windowing system.  ALT key
 		combinations cannot be mapped.
 	  menu	Using ALT in combination with a character that is a menu
 		shortcut key, will be handled by the windowing system.  Other
 		keys can be mapped.
 	If the menu is disabled by excluding `'m'`  from `'guioptions'` , the ALT
 	key is never used for the menu.
 	This option is not used for <F10>; on Win32.

## warn


```lua
boolean

 `'warn'` 			boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Give a warning message when a shell command is used while the buffer
 	has been changed.

## wb


```lua
vim.opt.writebackup
```

 `'writebackup'`  `'wb'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  The backup is removed after
 	the file was successfully written, unless the `'backup'`  option is
 	also on.
 	WARNING: Switching this option off means that when Vim fails to write
 	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
 	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only reset
 	this option if your file system is almost full and it makes the write
 	fail (and make sure not to exit Vim until the write was successful).
 	See |backup-table| for another explanation.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
 	Depending on `'backupcopy'`  the backup is a new file or the original
 	file renamed (and a new file is written).

## wbr


```lua
vim.opt.winbar
```

 `'winbar'`  `'wbr'` 		string (default empty)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	When non-empty, this option enables the window bar and determines its
 	contents. The window bar is a bar that's shown at the top of every
 	window with it enabled. The value of `'winbar'`  is evaluated like with
 	`'statusline'` .
 
 	When changing something that is used in `'winbar'`  that does not trigger
 	it to be updated, use |:redrawstatus|.
 
 	Floating windows do not use the global value of `'winbar'` . The
 	window-local value of `'winbar'`  must be set for a floating window to
 	have a window bar.
 
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.

## wc


```lua
vim.opt.wildchar
```

 `'wildchar'`  `'wc'` 		number	(default: <Tab>)
 			global
 	Character you have to type to start wildcard expansion in the
 	command-line, as specified with `'wildmode'` .
 	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.
 	The character is not recognized when used inside a macro.  See
 	`'wildcharm'`  for that.
 	Some keys will not work, such as CTRL-C, <CR> and Enter.
 	Although `'wc'`  is a number option, you can set it to a special key: >
 		:set wc=<Tab>
 <

## wcm


```lua
vim.opt.wildcharm
```

 `'wildcharm'`  `'wcm'` 	number	(default: none (0))
 			global
 	`'wildcharm'`  works exactly like `'wildchar'` , except that it is
 	recognized when used inside a macro.  You can find "spare" command-line
 	keys suitable for this option by looking at |ex-edit-index|.  Normally
 	you'll never actually type `'wildcharm'` , just use it in mappings that
 	automatically invoke completion mode, e.g.: >
 		:set wcm=<C-Z>
 		:cnoremap ss so $vim/sessions/*.vim<C-Z>
 <	Then after typing :ss you can use CTRL-P & CTRL-N.

 	|preview-window| and |quickfix-window|.
 	The height may be changed anyway when running out of room.

## wfw


```lua
vim.opt.winfixwidth
```

 `'winfixwidth'`  `'wfw'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Keep the window width when windows are opened or closed and
 	`'equalalways'`  is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.
 	The width may be changed anyway when running out of room.

## wh


```lua
vim.opt.winheight
```

 `'winheight'`  `'wh'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	Minimal number of lines for the current window.  This is not a hard
 	minimum, Vim will use fewer lines if there is not enough room.  If the
 	focus goes to a window that is smaller, its size is increased, at the
 	cost of the height of other windows.
 	Set `'winheight'`  to a small number for normal editing.
 	Set it to 999 to make the current window fill most of the screen.
 	Other windows will be only `'winminheight'`  high.  This has the drawback
 	that ":all" will create only two windows.  To avoid "vim -o 1 2 3 4"
 	to create only two windows, set the option after startup is done,
 	using the |VimEnter| event: >
 		au VimEnter * set winheight=999
 <	Minimum value is 1.
 	The height is not adjusted after one of the commands that change the
 	height of the current window.
 	`'winheight'`  applies to the current window.  Use `'winminheight'`  to set
 	the minimal height for other windows.

## whichwrap


```lua
string
```

 `'whichwrap'`  `'ww'` 	string	(default: "b,s")
 			global
 	Allow specified keys that move the cursor left/right to move to the
 	previous/next line when the cursor is on the first/last character in
 	the line.  Concatenate characters to allow this for these keys:
 		char   key	  mode	~
 		 b    <BS>	 Normal and Visual
 		 s    <Space>	 Normal and Visual
 		 h    "h"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
 		 l    "l"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
 		 <    <Left>	 Normal and Visual
 		 >    <Right>	 Normal and Visual
 		 ~    "~"	 Normal
 		 [    <Left>	 Insert and Replace
 		 ]    <Right>	 Insert and Replace
 	For example: >
 		:set ww=<,>,[,]
 <	allows wrap only when cursor keys are used.
 	When the movement keys are used in combination with a delete or change
 	operator, the <EOL> also counts for a character.  This makes "3h"
 	different from "3dh" when the cursor crosses the end of a line.  This
 	is also true for "x" and "X", because they do the same as "dl" and
 	"dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
 	":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the
 	cursor.
 	When `'l'`  is included and it is used after an operator at the end of a
 	line (not an empty line) then it will not move to the next line.  This
 	makes "dl", "cl", "yl" etc. work normally.

## wi


```lua
vim.opt.window
```

 `'window'`  `'wi'` 		number  (default screen height - 1)
 			global
 	Window height used for |CTRL-F| and |CTRL-B| when there is only one
 	window and the value is smaller than `'lines'`  minus one.  The screen
 	will scroll `'window'`  minus two lines, with a minimum of one.
 	When `'window'`  is equal to `'lines'`  minus one CTRL-F and CTRL-B scroll
 	in a much smarter way, taking care of wrapping lines.
 	When resizing the Vim window, the value is smaller than 1 or more than
 	or equal to `'lines'`  it will be set to `'lines'`  minus 1.
 	Note: Do not confuse this with the height of the Vim window, use
 	`'lines'`  for that.

## wic


```lua
vim.opt.wildignorecase
```

 `'wildignorecase'`  `'wic'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When set case is ignored when completing file names and directories.
 	Has no effect when `'fileignorecase'`  is set.
 	Does not apply when the shell is used to expand wildcards, which
 	happens when there are special characters.

## wig


```lua
vim.opt.wildignore
```

 `'wildignore'`  `'wig'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	A list of file patterns.  A file that matches with one of these
 	patterns is ignored when expanding |wildcards|, completing file or
 	directory names, and influences the result of |expand()|, |glob()| and
 	|globpath()| unless a flag is passed to disable this.
 	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-pattern|.
 	Also see `'suffixes'` .
 	Example: >
 		:set wildignore=.obj
 <	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	a pattern from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.

## wildchar


```lua
integer
```

 `'wildchar'`  `'wc'` 		number	(default: <Tab>)
 			global
 	Character you have to type to start wildcard expansion in the
 	command-line, as specified with `'wildmode'` .
 	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.
 	The character is not recognized when used inside a macro.  See
 	`'wildcharm'`  for that.
 	Some keys will not work, such as CTRL-C, <CR> and Enter.
 	Although `'wc'`  is a number option, you can set it to a special key: >
 		:set wc=<Tab>
 <

## wildcharm


```lua
integer
```

 `'wildcharm'`  `'wcm'` 	number	(default: none (0))
 			global
 	`'wildcharm'`  works exactly like `'wildchar'` , except that it is
 	recognized when used inside a macro.  You can find "spare" command-line
 	keys suitable for this option by looking at |ex-edit-index|.  Normally
 	you'll never actually type `'wildcharm'` , just use it in mappings that
 	automatically invoke completion mode, e.g.: >
 		:set wcm=<C-Z>
 		:cnoremap ss so $vim/sessions/*.vim<C-Z>
 <	Then after typing :ss you can use CTRL-P & CTRL-N.

## wildignore


```lua
string
```

 `'wildignore'`  `'wig'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	A list of file patterns.  A file that matches with one of these
 	patterns is ignored when expanding |wildcards|, completing file or
 	directory names, and influences the result of |expand()|, |glob()| and
 	|globpath()| unless a flag is passed to disable this.
 	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-pattern|.
 	Also see `'suffixes'` .
 	Example: >
 		:set wildignore=.obj
 <	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	a pattern from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.

## wildignorecase


```lua
boolean
```

 `'wildignorecase'`  `'wic'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	When set case is ignored when completing file names and directories.
 	Has no effect when `'fileignorecase'`  is set.
 	Does not apply when the shell is used to expand wildcards, which
 	happens when there are special characters.

## wildmenu


```lua
boolean
```

 `'wildmenu'`  `'wmnu'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When `'wildmenu'`  is on, command-line completion operates in an enhanced
 	mode.  On pressing `'wildchar'`  (usually <Tab>) to invoke completion,
 	the possible matches are shown.
 	When `'wildoptions'`  contains "pum", then the completion matches are
 	shown in a popup menu.  Otherwise they are displayed just above the
 	command line, with the first match highlighted (overwriting the status
 	line, if there is one).
 	Keys that show the previous/next match, such as <Tab> or
 	CTRL-P/CTRL-N, cause the highlight to move to the appropriate match.
 	`'wildmode'`  must specify "full": "longest" and "list" do not start
 	`'wildmenu'`  mode. You can check the current mode with |wildmenumode()|.
 	The menu is cancelled when a key is hit that is not used for selecting
 	a completion.
 
 	While the menu is active these keys have special meanings:
 
 	CTRL-Y		- accept the currently selected match and stop
 			  completion.
 	CTRL-E		- end completion, go back to what was there before
 			  selecting a match.
 	<Left> <Right>	- select previous/next match (like CTRL-P/CTRL-N)
 	<Down>		- in filename/menu name completion: move into a
 			  subdirectory or submenu.
 	<CR>		- in menu completion, when the cursor is just after a
 			  dot: move into a submenu.
 	<Up>		- in filename/menu name completion: move up into
 			  parent directory or parent menu.
 
 	If you want <Left> and <Right> to move the cursor instead of selecting
 	a different match, use this: >
 		:cnoremap <Left> <Space><BS><Left>
 		:cnoremap <Right> <Space><BS><Right>
 <
 	|hl-WildMenu| highlights the current match.

## wildmode


```lua
string
```

 `'wildmode'`  `'wim'` 	string	(default: "full")
 			global
 	Completion mode that is used for the character specified with
 	`'wildchar'` .  It is a comma-separated list of up to four parts.  Each
 	part specifies what to do for each consecutive use of `'wildchar'` .  The
 	first part specifies the behavior for the first use of `'wildchar'` ,
 	The second part for the second use, etc.
 
 	Each part consists of a colon separated list consisting of the
 	following possible values:
 	""		Complete only the first match.
 	"full"		Complete the next full match.  After the last match,
 			the original string is used and then the first match
 			again.  Will also start `'wildmenu'`  if it is enabled.
 	"longest"	Complete till longest common string.  If this doesn't
 			result in a longer string, use the next part.
 	"list"		When more than one match, list all matches.
 	"lastused"	When completing buffer names and more than one buffer
 			matches, sort buffers by time last used (other than
 			the current buffer).
 	When there is only a single match, it is fully completed in all cases.
 
 	Examples of useful colon-separated values:
 	"longest:full"	Like "longest", but also start `'wildmenu'`  if it is
 			enabled.  Will not complete to the next full match.
 	"list:full"	When more than one match, list all matches and
 			complete first match.
 	"list:longest"	When more than one match, list all matches and
 			complete till longest common string.
 	"list:lastused" When more than one buffer matches, list all matches
 			and sort buffers by time last used (other than the
 			current buffer).
 
 	Examples: >
 		:set wildmode=full
 <	Complete first full match, next match, etc.  (the default) >
 		:set wildmode=longest,full
 <	Complete longest common string, then each full match >
 		:set wildmode=list:full
 <	List all matches and complete each full match >
 		:set wildmode=list,full
 <	List all matches without completing, then each full match >
 		:set wildmode=longest,list
 <	Complete longest common string, then list alternatives.
 	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.

## wildoptions


```lua
string
```

 `'wildoptions'`  `'wop'` 	string	(default "pum,tagfile")
 			global
 	A list of words that change how |cmdline-completion| is done.
 	The following values are supported:
 	  fuzzy		Use |fuzzy-matching| to find completion matches. When
 			this value is specified, wildcard expansion will not
 			be used for completion.  The matches will be sorted by
 			the "best match" rather than alphabetically sorted.
 			This will find more matches than the wildcard
 			expansion. Currently fuzzy matching based completion
 			is not supported for file and directory names and
 			instead wildcard expansion is used.
 	  pum		Display the completion matches using the popup menu
 			in the same style as the |ins-completion-menu|.
 	  tagfile	When using CTRL-D to list matching tags, the kind of
 			tag and the file of the tag is listed.	Only one match
 			is displayed per line.  Often used tag kinds are:
 				d	#define
 				f	function

## wim


```lua
vim.opt.wildmode
```

 `'wildmode'`  `'wim'` 	string	(default: "full")
 			global
 	Completion mode that is used for the character specified with
 	`'wildchar'` .  It is a comma-separated list of up to four parts.  Each

## winaltkeys


```lua
string
```

 `'winaltkeys'`  `'wak'` 	string	(default "menu")
 			global
 			{only used in Win32}
 	Some GUI versions allow the access to menu entries by using the ALT
 	key in combination with a character that appears underlined in the
 	menu.  This conflicts with the use of the ALT key for mappings and
 	entering special characters.  This option tells what to do:
 	  no	Don't use ALT keys for menus.  ALT key combinations can be
 		mapped, but there is no automatic handling.
 	  yes	ALT key handling is done by the windowing system.  ALT key
 		combinations cannot be mapped.
 	  menu	Using ALT in combination with a character that is a menu
 		shortcut key, will be handled by the windowing system.  Other
 		keys can be mapped.
 	If the menu is disabled by excluding `'m'`  from `'guioptions'` , the ALT
 	key is never used for the menu.
 	This option is not used for <F10>; on Win32.

## winbar


```lua
string
```

 `'winbar'`  `'wbr'` 		string (default empty)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	When non-empty, this option enables the window bar and determines its
 	contents. The window bar is a bar that's shown at the top of every
 	window with it enabled. The value of `'winbar'`  is evaluated like with
 	`'statusline'` .
 
 	When changing something that is used in `'winbar'`  that does not trigger
 	it to be updated, use |:redrawstatus|.
 
 	Floating windows do not use the global value of `'winbar'` . The
 	window-local value of `'winbar'`  must be set for a floating window to
 	have a window bar.
 
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.

## winbl


```lua
vim.opt.winblend
```

 `'winblend'`  `'winbl'` 		number	(default 0)
 			local to window
 	Enables pseudo-transparency for a floating window. Valid values are in
 	the range of 0 for fully opaque window (disabled) to 100 for fully
 	transparent background. Values between 0-30 are typically most useful.
 
 	UI-dependent. Works best with RGB colors. `'termguicolors'` 

## winblend


```lua
integer
```

 `'winblend'`  `'winbl'` 		number	(default 0)
 			local to window
 	Enables pseudo-transparency for a floating window. Valid values are in
 	the range of 0 for fully opaque window (disabled) to 100 for fully
 	transparent background. Values between 0-30 are typically most useful.
 
 	UI-dependent. Works best with RGB colors. `'termguicolors'` 

## window


```lua
integer
```

 `'window'`  `'wi'` 		number  (default screen height - 1)
 			global
 	Window height used for |CTRL-F| and |CTRL-B| when there is only one
 	window and the value is smaller than `'lines'`  minus one.  The screen
 	will scroll `'window'`  minus two lines, with a minimum of one.
 	When `'window'`  is equal to `'lines'`  minus one CTRL-F and CTRL-B scroll
 	in a much smarter way, taking care of wrapping lines.
 	When resizing the Vim window, the value is smaller than 1 or more than
 	or equal to `'lines'`  it will be set to `'lines'`  minus 1.
 	Note: Do not confuse this with the height of the Vim window, use
 	`'lines'`  for that.

## winfixheight


```lua
boolean
```

 `'winfixheight'`  `'wfh'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Keep the window height when windows are opened or closed and
 	`'equalalways'`  is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.  Set by default for the
 	|preview-window| and |quickfix-window|.
 	The height may be changed anyway when running out of room.

## winfixwidth


```lua
boolean
```

 `'winfixwidth'`  `'wfw'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Keep the window width when windows are opened or closed and
 	`'equalalways'`  is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.
 	The width may be changed anyway when running out of room.

## winheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'winheight'`  `'wh'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	Minimal number of lines for the current window.  This is not a hard
 	minimum, Vim will use fewer lines if there is not enough room.  If the
 	focus goes to a window that is smaller, its size is increased, at the
 	cost of the height of other windows.
 	Set `'winheight'`  to a small number for normal editing.
 	Set it to 999 to make the current window fill most of the screen.
 	Other windows will be only `'winminheight'`  high.  This has the drawback
 	that ":all" will create only two windows.  To avoid "vim -o 1 2 3 4"
 	to create only two windows, set the option after startup is done,
 	using the |VimEnter| event: >
 		au VimEnter * set winheight=999
 <	Minimum value is 1.
 	The height is not adjusted after one of the commands that change the
 	height of the current window.
 	`'winheight'`  applies to the current window.  Use `'winminheight'`  to set
 	the minimal height for other windows.

## winhighlight


```lua
string
```

 `'winhighlight'`  `'winhl'` 	string (default empty)
 			local to window
 	Window-local highlights.  Comma-delimited list of highlight
 	|group-name| pairs "{hl-from}:{hl-to},..." where each {hl-from} is
 	a |highlight-groups| item to be overridden by {hl-to} group in
 	the window.
 
 	Note: highlight namespaces take precedence over `'winhighlight'` .
 	See |nvim_win_set_hl_ns()| and |nvim_set_hl()|.
 
 	Highlights of vertical separators are determined by the window to the
 	left of the separator.  The `'tabline'`  highlight of a tabpage is
 	decided by the last-focused window of the tabpage.  Highlights of
 	the popupmenu are determined by the current window.  Highlights in the
 	message area cannot be overridden.
 
 	Example: show a different color for non-current windows: >
 		set winhighlight=Normal:MyNormal,NormalNC:MyNormalNC
 <

## winhl


```lua
vim.opt.winhighlight
```

 `'winhighlight'`  `'winhl'` 	string (default empty)
 			local to window
 	Window-local highlights.  Comma-delimited list of highlight

## winminheight


```lua
integer
```

 `'winminheight'`  `'wmh'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The minimal height of a window, when it's not the current window.
 	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
 	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero lines (i.e. just a
 	status bar) if necessary.  They will return to at least one line when
 	they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere to go.)
 	Use `'winheight'`  to set the minimal height of the current window.
 	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
 	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
 	windows.  A value of 0 to 3 is reasonable.

## winminwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'winminwidth'`  `'wmw'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The minimal width of a window, when it's not the current window.
 	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
 	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero columns (i.e. just
 	a vertical separator) if necessary.  They will return to at least one
 	line when they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere
 	to go.)
 	Use `'winwidth'`  to set the minimal width of the current window.
 	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
 	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
 	windows.  A value of 0 to 12 is reasonable.

## winwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'winwidth'`  `'wiw'` 	number	(default 20)
 			global
 	Minimal number of columns for the current window.  This is not a hard
 	minimum, Vim will use fewer columns if there is not enough room.  If
 	the current window is smaller, its size is increased, at the cost of
 	the width of other windows.  Set it to 999 to make the current window
 	always fill the screen.  Set it to a small number for normal editing.
 	The width is not adjusted after one of the commands to change the
 	width of the current window.
 	`'winwidth'`  applies to the current window.  Use `'winminwidth'`  to set
 	the minimal width for other windows.

## wiw

```lua
vim.opt.wrapmargin
```

 `'wrapmargin'`  `'wm'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of characters from the right window border where wrapping
 	starts.  When typing text beyond this limit, an <EOL> will be inserted
 	and inserting continues on the next line.
 	Options that add a margin, such as `'number'`  and `'foldcolumn'` , cause
 	the text width to be further reduced.
 	When `'textwidth'`  is non-zero, this option is not used.
 	See also `'formatoptions'`  and |ins-textwidth|.

## wmh


```lua
vim.opt.winminheight
```

 `'winminheight'`  `'wmh'` 	number	(default 1)
 			global
 	The minimal height of a window, when it's not the current window.
 	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
 	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero lines (i.e. just a

 	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
 	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
 	windows.  A value of 0 to 12 is reasonable.

## wop


```lua
vim.opt.wildoptions
```

 `'wildoptions'`  `'wop'` 	string	(default "pum,tagfile")
 			global
 	A list of words that change how |cmdline-completion| is done.
 	The following values are supported:
 	  fuzzy		Use |fuzzy-matching| to find completion matches. When
 			this value is specified, wildcard expansion will not
 			be used for completion.  The matches will be sorted by
 			the "best match" rather than alphabetically sorted.
 			This will find more matches than the wildcard
 			expansion. Currently fuzzy matching based completion
 			is not supported for file and directory names and
 			instead wildcard expansion is used.
 	  pum		Display the completion matches using the popup menu
 			in the same style as the |ins-completion-menu|.
 	  tagfile	When using CTRL-D to list matching tags, the kind of
 			tag and the file of the tag is listed.	Only one match
 			is displayed per line.  Often used tag kinds are:
 				d	#define
 				f	function

## wrap


```lua
boolean
```

 `'wrap'` 			boolean	(default on)
 			local to window
 	This option changes how text is displayed.  It doesn't change the text
 	in the buffer, see `'textwidth'`  for that.
 	When on, lines longer than the width of the window will wrap and
 	displaying continues on the next line.  When off lines will not wrap
 	and only part of long lines will be displayed.  When the cursor is
 	moved to a part that is not shown, the screen will scroll
 	horizontally.
 	The line will be broken in the middle of a word if necessary.  See
 	`'linebreak'`  to get the break at a word boundary.
 	To make scrolling horizontally a bit more useful, try this: >
 		:set sidescroll=5
 		:set listchars+=precedes:<,extends:>
 <	See `'sidescroll'` , `'listchars'`  and |wrap-off|.
 	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the `'diff'`  option is
 	on.

## wrapmargin


```lua
integer
```

 `'wrapmargin'`  `'wm'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of characters from the right window border where wrapping
 	starts.  When typing text beyond this limit, an <EOL> will be inserted
 	and inserting continues on the next line.
 	Options that add a margin, such as `'number'`  and `'foldcolumn'` , cause
 	the text width to be further reduced.
 	When `'textwidth'`  is non-zero, this option is not used.
 	See also `'formatoptions'`  and |ins-textwidth|.

## wrapscan


```lua
boolean
```

 `'wrapscan'`  `'ws'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Searches wrap around the end of the file.  Also applies to |]s| and
 	|[s|, searching for spelling mistakes.

## write


```lua
boolean
```

 `'write'` 			boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Allows writing files.  When not set, writing a file is not allowed.
 	Can be used for a view-only mode, where modifications to the text are
 	still allowed.  Can be reset with the |-m| or |-M| command line
 	argument.  Filtering text is still possible, even though this requires
 	writing a temporary file.

## writeany


```lua
boolean
```

 `'writeany'`  `'wa'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			global
 	Allows writing to any file with no need for "!" override.

## writebackup


```lua
boolean
```

 `'writebackup'`  `'wb'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  The backup is removed after
 	the file was successfully written, unless the `'backup'`  option is
 	also on.
 	WARNING: Switching this option off means that when Vim fails to write
 	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
 	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only reset
 	this option if your file system is almost full and it makes the write
 	fail (and make sure not to exit Vim until the write was successful).
 	See |backup-table| for another explanation.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
 	Depending on `'backupcopy'`  the backup is a new file or the original
 	file renamed (and a new file is written).

## writedelay


```lua
integer
```

## ws


```lua
vim.opt.wrapscan
```

 `'wrapscan'`  `'ws'` 		boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Searches wrap around the end of the file.  Also applies to |]s| and
 	|[s|, searching for spelling mistakes.

## ww


```lua
vim.opt.whichwrap
```

 `'whichwrap'`  `'ww'` 	string	(default: "b,s")
 			global
 	Allow specified keys that move the cursor left/right to move to the
 	previous/next line when the cursor is on the first/last character in
 	the line.  Concatenate characters to allow this for these keys:
 		char   key	  mode	~
 		 b    <BS>	 Normal and Visual
 		 s    <Space>	 Normal and Visual
 		 h    "h"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
 		 l    "l"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
 		 <    <Left>	 Normal and Visual
 		 >    <Right>	 Normal and Visual
 		 ~    "~"	 Normal
 		 [    <Left>	 Insert and Replace
 		 ]    <Right>	 Insert and Replace
 	For example: >
 		:set ww=<,>,[,]
 <	allows wrap only when cursor keys are used.
 	When the movement keys are used in combination with a delete or change
 	operator, the <EOL> also counts for a character.  This makes "3h"
 	different from "3dh" when the cursor crosses the end of a line.  This
 	is also true for "x" and "X", because they do the same as "dl" and
 	"dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
 	":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the
 	cursor.
 	When `'l'`  is included and it is used after an operator at the end of a
 	line (not an empty line) then it will not move to the next line.  This
 	makes "dl", "cl", "yl" etc. work normally.

# vim.opt.ambiwidth

 `'ambiwidth'`  `'ambw'` 	string (default: "single")
 			global
 	Tells Vim what to do with characters with East Asian Width Class
 	Ambiguous (such as Euro, Registered Sign, Copyright Sign, Greek
 	letters, Cyrillic letters).
 
 	There are currently two possible values:
 	"single":	Use the same width as characters in US-ASCII.  This is
 			expected by most users.
 	"double":	Use twice the width of ASCII characters.
 
 	The value "double" cannot be used if `'listchars'`  or `'fillchars'` 
 	contains a character that would be double width.  These errors may
 	also be given when calling setcellwidths().
 
 	The values are overruled for characters specified with
 	|setcellwidths()|.
 
 	There are a number of CJK fonts for which the width of glyphs for
 	those characters are solely based on how many octets they take in
 	legacy/traditional CJK encodings.  In those encodings, Euro,
 	Registered sign, Greek/Cyrillic letters are represented by two octets,
 	therefore those fonts have "wide" glyphs for them.  This is also
 	true of some line drawing characters used to make tables in text
 	file.  Therefore, when a CJK font is used for GUI Vim or
 	Vim is running inside a terminal (emulators) that uses a CJK font
 	(or Vim is run inside an xterm invoked with "-cjkwidth" option.),
 	this option should be set to "double" to match the width perceived
 	by Vim with the width of glyphs in the font.  Perhaps it also has
 	to be set to "double" under CJK MS-Windows when the system locale is
 	set to one of CJK locales.  See Unicode Standard Annex #11
 	(https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11).

 	in Insert mode or when using the "o" or "O" command).  If you do not
 	type anything on the new line except <BS> or CTRL-D and then type
 	<Esc>, CTRL-O or <CR>, the indent is deleted again.  Moving the cursor
 	to another line has the same effect, unless the `'I'`  flag is included
 	in `'cpoptions'` .
 	When autoindent is on, formatting (with the "gq" command or when you

# vim.opt.background

 			global
 	When set to "dark" or "light", adjusts the default color groups for
 	that background type.  The |TUI| or other UI sets this on startup
 	(triggering |OptionSet|) if it can detect the background color.
 
 	This option does NOT change the background color, it tells Nvim what
 	the "inherited" (terminal/GUI) background looks like.
 	See |:hi-normal| if you want to set the background color explicitly.
 
 	When a color scheme is loaded (the "g:colors_name" variable is set)
 	setting `'background'`  will cause the color scheme to be reloaded.  If
 	the color scheme adjusts to the value of `'background'`  this will work.
 	However, if the color scheme sets `'background'`  itself the effect may
 	be undone.  First delete the "g:colors_name" variable when needed.
 
 	Normally this option would be set in the vimrc file.  Possibly
 	depending on the terminal name.  Example: >
 		:if $TERM ==# "xterm"
 		:  set background=dark
 		:endif
 <	When this option is set, the default settings for the highlight groups
 	will change.  To use other settings, place ":highlight" commands AFTER
 	the setting of the `'background'`  option.
 	This option is also used in the "$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim" file

# vim.opt.backupcopy

 `'backupcopy'`  `'bkc'` 	string	(default: "auto")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
 	done.  This is a comma-separated list of words.
 
 	The main values are:
 	"yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
 	"no"	rename the file and write a new one
 	"auto"	one of the previous, what works best
 
 	Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
 	"breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
 	"breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing
 
 	Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
 	- Takes extra time to copy the file.
 	+ When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
 	  has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
 	- When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
 	  not of the real file.
 
 	Renaming the file and writing a new one:
 	+ It's fast.
 	- Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
 	  file.
 	- When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.
 
 	The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming the
 	file is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on
 	and the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected,
 	a copy will be made.
 
 	The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
 	combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
 	force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
 	exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
 	become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
 	useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
 	hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
 	be propagated back to the original source.
 
 	One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
 	that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
 	the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
 	backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
 	example.
 
 	When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
 	with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
 	symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file,
 	however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
 	group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
 	fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
 	others.
 
 	When the file is renamed, this is the other way around: The backup has
 	the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
 	is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
 	link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
 	rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
 	written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
 	the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
 	again not rename the file.

# vim.opt.backupdir

 `'backupdir'`  `'bdir'` 	string	(default ".,$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/backup//")
 			global
 	List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
 	- The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
 	  where this is possible.  If none of the directories exist Nvim will
 	  attempt to create the last directory in the list.
 	- Empty means that no backup file will be created (`'patchmode'`  is
 	  impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
 	- A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
 	  as the edited file.
 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
 	  the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
 	  ("." inside a directory name has no special meaning).
 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
 	- A directory name may end in an `'/'` .
 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
 	  with all path separators changed to percent `'%'`  signs. This will
 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the backup directory.
 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
 	  use `'//'` , instead of `'\\'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type one before a space, type two to
 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
 	    :set bdir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
 <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a `'>'`  at the start
 	  of the option is removed.
 	See also `'backup'`  and `'writebackup'`  options.
 	If you want to hide your backup files on Unix, consider this value: >
 		:set backupdir=./.backup,~/.backup,.,/tmp
 <	You must create a ".backup" directory in each directory and in your
 	home directory for this to work properly.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

# vim.opt.backupext

 `'backupext'`  `'bex'` 	string	(default "~")
 			global
 	String which is appended to a file name to make the name of the
 	backup file.  The default is quite unusual, because this avoids
 	accidentally overwriting existing files with a backup file.  You might
 	prefer using ".bak", but make sure that you don't have files with
 	".bak" that you want to keep.
 	Only normal file name characters can be used; "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
 
 	If you like to keep a lot of backups, you could use a BufWritePre
 	autocommand to change `'backupext'`  just before writing the file to
 	include a timestamp. >
 		:au BufWritePre * let &bex = `'-'`  .. strftime("%Y%b%d%X") .. `'~'`

# vim.opt.backupskip

 `'backupskip'`  `'bsk'` 	string	(default: "$TMPDIR/,$TEMP/*"
 				 Unix: "/tmp/,$TMP/"
 				 Mac: "/private/tmp/,$TMP/")
 			global
 	A list of file patterns.  When one of the patterns matches with the
 	name of the file which is written, no backup file is created.  Both
 	the specified file name and the full path name of the file are used.
 	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-pattern|.
 	Watch out for special characters, see |option-backslash|.
 	When $TMPDIR, $TMP or $TEMP is not defined, it is not used for the
 	default value.  "/tmp/*" is only used for Unix.
 
 	WARNING: Not having a backup file means that when Vim fails to write
 	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
 	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only disable
 	backups if you don't care about losing the file.
 
 	Note that environment variables are not expanded.  If you want to use
 	$HOME you must expand it explicitly, e.g.: >
 		:let &backupskip = escape(expand(`'$HOME'` ), `'\'` ) .. `'/tmp/*'` 
 
 <	Note that the default also makes sure that "crontab -e" works (when a
 	backup would be made by renaming the original file crontab won't see
 	the newly created file).  Also see `'backupcopy'`  and |crontab|.

# vim.opt.belloff

 	will be silenced. This is most useful to specify specific events in
 	insert mode to be silenced.
 
 	item	    meaning when present	~
 	all	    All events.
 	backspace   When hitting <BS> or <Del> and deleting results in an
 		    error.

 	indicate that an error occurred. It can be silenced by adding the
 	"error" keyword.

# vim.opt.binary

 `'binary'`  `'bin'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	This option should be set before editing a binary file.  You can also
 	use the |-b| Vim argument.  When this option is switched on a few
 	options will be changed (also when it already was on):
 		`'textwidth'`   will be set to 0
 		`'wrapmargin'`  will be set to 0
 		`'modeline'`    will be off
 		`'expandtab'`   will be off
 	Also, `'fileformat'`  and `'fileformats'`  options will not be used, the
 	file is read and written like `'fileformat'`  was "unix" (a single <NL>
 	separates lines).
 	The `'fileencoding'`  and `'fileencodings'`  options will not be used, the
 	file is read without conversion.
 	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the `'bin'`  option is
 	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
 	`'textwidth'` ), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
 	`'bin'`  again when the file has been loaded.
 	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when
 	`'bin'`  is switched from on to off.  Each buffer has its own set of
 	saved option values.
 	To edit a file with `'binary'`  set you can use the |++bin| argument.
 	This avoids you have to do ":set bin", which would have effect for all
 	files you edit.
 	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
 	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
 	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See
 	the `'endofline'`  option.

# vim.opt.bomb

 `'bomb'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	When writing a file and the following conditions are met, a BOM (Byte
 	Order Mark) is prepended to the file:
 	- this option is on
 	- the `'binary'`  option is off
 	- `'fileencoding'`  is "utf-8", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" or one of the little/big
 	  endian variants.
 	Some applications use the BOM to recognize the encoding of the file.
 	Often used for UCS-2 files on MS-Windows.  For other applications it
 	causes trouble, for example: "cat file1 file2" makes the BOM of file2
 	appear halfway through the resulting file.  Gcc doesn't accept a BOM.
 	When Vim reads a file and `'fileencodings'`  starts with "ucs-bom", a
 	check for the presence of the BOM is done and `'bomb'`  set accordingly.
 	Unless `'binary'`  is set, it is removed from the first line, so that you
 	don't see it when editing.  When you don't change the options, the BOM
 	will be restored when writing the file.

# vim.opt.breakindentopt

 `'breakindentopt'`  `'briopt'`  string (default empty)
 			local to window
 	Settings for `'breakindent'` . It can consist of the following optional
 	items and must be separated by a comma:
 		min:{n}	    Minimum text width that will be kept after
 			    applying `'breakindent'` , even if the resulting
 			    text should normally be narrower. This prevents
 			    text indented almost to the right window border
 			    occupying lot of vertical space when broken.
 			    (default: 20)
 		shift:{n}   After applying `'breakindent'` , the wrapped line's
 			    beginning will be shifted by the given number of
 			    characters.  It permits dynamic French paragraph
 			    indentation (negative) or emphasizing the line
 			    continuation (positive).
 			    (default: 0)
 		sbr	    Display the `'showbreak'`  value before applying the
 			    additional indent.
 			    (default: off)
 		list:{n}    Adds an additional indent for lines that match a
 			    numbered or bulleted list (using the
 			    `'formatlistpat'`  setting).
 		list:-1	    Uses the length of a match with `'formatlistpat'` 
 			    for indentation.
 			    (default: 0)
 		column:{n}  Indent at column {n}. Will overrule the other

 	  hide		hide the buffer (don't unload it), even if `'hidden'`  is

 			|:hide| command will also unload the buffer
 	  delete	delete the buffer from the buffer list, even if
 			`'hidden'`  is set; the |:hide| command will also delete
 			the buffer, making it behave like |:bdelete|
 	  wipe		wipe the buffer from the buffer list, even if
 			`'hidden'`  is set; the |:hide| command will also wipe
 			out the buffer, making it behave like |:bwipeout|
 
 	CAREFUL: when "unload", "delete" or "wipe" is used changes in a buffer
 	are lost without a warning.  Also, these values may break autocommands

# vim.opt.buftype

 `'buftype'`  `'bt'` 		string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	The value of this option specifies the type of a buffer:
 	  <empty>	normal buffer
 	  acwrite	buffer will always be written with |BufWriteCmd|s
 	  help		help buffer (do not set this manually)
 	  nofile	buffer is not related to a file, will not be written
 	  nowrite	buffer will not be written
 	  quickfix	list of errors |:cwindow| or locations |:lwindow|
 	  terminal	|terminal-emulator| buffer
 	  prompt	buffer where only the last line can be edited, meant
 			to be used by a plugin, see |prompt-buffer|
 
 	This option is used together with `'bufhidden'`  and `'swapfile'`  to
 	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.
 	Also see |win_gettype()|, which returns the type of the window.
 
 	Be careful with changing this option, it can have many side effects!
 	One such effect is that Vim will not check the timestamp of the file,
 	if the file is changed by another program this will not be noticed.
 
 	A "quickfix" buffer is only used for the error list and the location
 	list.  This value is set by the |:cwindow| and |:lwindow| commands and
 	you are not supposed to change it.
 
 	"nofile" and "nowrite" buffers are similar:
 	both:		The buffer is not to be written to disk, ":w" doesn't
 			work (":w filename" does work though).
 	both:		The buffer is never considered to be |`'modified'` |.
 			There is no warning when the changes will be lost, for
 			example when you quit Vim.
 	both:		A swap file is only created when using too much memory
 			(when `'swapfile'`  has been reset there is never a swap
 			file).
 	nofile only:	The buffer name is fixed, it is not handled like a
 			file name.  It is not modified in response to a |:cd|
 			command.
 	both:		When using ":e bufname" and already editing "bufname"
 			the buffer is made empty and autocommands are
 			triggered as usual for |:edit|.
 
 	"acwrite" implies that the buffer name is not related to a file, like
 	"nofile", but it will be written.  Thus, in contrast to "nofile" and
 	"nowrite", ":w" does work and a modified buffer can't be abandoned
 	without saving.  For writing there must be matching |BufWriteCmd|,
 	|FileWriteCmd| or |FileAppendCmd| autocommands.

# vim.opt.charconvert

 `'charconvert'`  `'ccv'` 	string (default "")
 			global
 	An expression that is used for character encoding conversion.  It is
 	evaluated when a file that is to be read or has been written has a
 	different encoding from what is desired.
 	`'charconvert'`  is not used when the internal iconv() function is
 	supported and is able to do the conversion.  Using iconv() is
 	preferred, because it is much faster.
 	`'charconvert'`  is not used when reading stdin |--|, because there is no
 	file to convert from.  You will have to save the text in a file first.
 	The expression must return zero, false or an empty string for success,
 	non-zero or true for failure.
 	See |encoding-names| for possible encoding names.
 	Additionally, names given in `'fileencodings'`  and `'fileencoding'`  are
 	used.
 	Conversion between "latin1", "unicode", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" and "utf-8"
 	is done internally by Vim, `'charconvert'`  is not used for this.
 	Also used for Unicode conversion.
 	Example: >
 		set charconvert=CharConvert()
 		fun CharConvert()
 		  system("recode "
 			\ .. v:charconvert_from .. ".." .. v:charconvert_to
 			\ .. " <" .. v:fname_in .. " >" .. v:fname_out)
 		  return v:shell_error
 		endfun
 <	The related Vim variables are:

# vim.opt.cindent

 `'cindent'`  `'cin'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Enables automatic C program indenting.  See `'cinkeys'`  to set the keys
 	that trigger reindenting in insert mode and `'cinoptions'`  to set your
 	preferred indent style.
 	If `'indentexpr'`  is not empty, it overrules `'cindent'` .
 	If `'lisp'`  is not on and both `'indentexpr'`  and `'equalprg'`  are empty,
 	the "=" operator indents using this algorithm rather than calling an
 	external program.
 	See |C-indenting|.
 	When you don't like the way `'cindent'`  works, try the `'smartindent'` 
 	option or `'indentexpr'` .

 			register "*" for all yank, delete, change and put
 			operations which would normally go to the unnamed
 			register.  When "unnamed" is also included to the

 	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
 	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
 	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |ginit.vim| file.
 	When you set this option and Vim is unable to change the physical
 	number of columns of the display, the display may be messed up.  For
 	the GUI it is always possible and Vim limits the number of columns to
 	what fits on the screen.  You can use this command to get the widest

 	completion |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L|.  It indicates the type of completion
 	and the places to scan.  It is a comma-separated list of flags:
 	.	scan the current buffer (`'wrapscan'`  is ignored)
 	w	scan buffers from other windows
 	b	scan other loaded buffers that are in the buffer list
 	u	scan the unloaded buffers that are in the buffer list
 	U	scan the buffers that are not in the buffer list
 	k	scan the files given with the `'dictionary'`  option
 	kspell  use the currently active spell checking |spell|
 	k{dict}	scan the file {dict}.  Several "k" flags can be given,
 		patterns are valid too.  For example: >
 			:set cpt=k/usr/dict/*,k~/spanish
 <	s	scan the files given with the `'thesaurus'`  option
 	s{tsr}	scan the file {tsr}.  Several "s" flags can be given, patterns
 		are valid too.
 	i	scan current and included files
 	d	scan current and included files for defined name or macro
 		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D|
 	]	tag completion
 	t	same as "]"
 
 	Unloaded buffers are not loaded, thus their autocmds |:autocmd| are
 	not executed, this may lead to unexpected completions from some files
 	(gzipped files for example).  Unloaded buffers are not scanned for
 	whole-line completion.
 
 	As you can see, CTRL-N and CTRL-P can be used to do any `'iskeyword'` -
 	based expansion (e.g., dictionary |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|, included patterns
 	|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I|, tags |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]| and normal expansions).

 	   menu	    Use a popup menu to show the possible completions.  The
 		    menu is only shown when there is more than one match and
 		    sufficient colors are available.  |ins-completion-menu|
 
 	   menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
 		    Useful when there is additional information about the
 		    match, e.g., what file it comes from.
 
 	   longest  Only insert the longest common text of the matches.  If
 		    the menu is displayed you can use CTRL-L to add more
 		    characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
 		    of completion.  For buffer text the `'ignorecase'`  option is
 		    used.
 
 	   preview  Show extra information about the currently selected
 		    completion in the preview window.  Only works in
 		    combination with "menu" or "menuone".
 
 	  noinsert  Do not insert any text for a match until the user selects
 		    a match from the menu. Only works in combination with
 		    "menu" or "menuone". No effect if "longest" is present.

# vim.opt.cpoptions

 `'cpoptions'`  `'cpo'` 	string	(default: "aABceFs_")
 			global
 	A sequence of single character flags.  When a character is present
 	this indicates Vi-compatible behavior.  This is used for things where
 	not being Vi-compatible is mostly or sometimes preferred.
 	`'cpoptions'`  stands for "compatible-options".
 	Commas can be added for readability.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
 
 	    contains	behavior	~
 
 		a	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
 			argument will set the alternate file name for the
 			current window.
 
 		A	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
 			argument will set the alternate file name for the
 			current window.
 
 		b	"\|" in a ":map" command is recognized as the end of
 			the map command.  The `'\'`  is included in the mapping,
 			the text after the `'|'`  is interpreted as the next
 			command.  Use a CTRL-V instead of a backslash to
 			include the `'|'`  in the mapping.  Applies to all
 			mapping, abbreviation, menu and autocmd commands.
 			See also |map_bar|.
 
 		B	A backslash has no special meaning in mappings,
 			abbreviations, user commands and the "to" part of the
 			menu commands.  Remove this flag to be able to use a
 			backslash like a CTRL-V.  For example, the command
 			":map X \<Esc>" results in X being mapped to:
 				`'B'`  included:	"\^["	 (^[ is a real <Esc>)
 				`'B'`  excluded:	"<Esc>"  (5 characters)
 
 		c	Searching continues at the end of any match at the
 			cursor position, but not further than the start of the
 			next line.  When not present searching continues
 			one character from the cursor position.  With `'c'` 
 			"abababababab" only gets three matches when repeating
 			"/abab", without `'c'`  there are five matches.
 
 		C	Do not concatenate sourced lines that start with a
 			backslash.  See |line-continuation|.
 
 		d	Using "./" in the `'tags'`  option doesn't mean to use
 			the tags file relative to the current file, but the
 			tags file in the current directory.
 
 		D	Can't use CTRL-K to enter a digraph after Normal mode
 			commands with a character argument, like |r|, |f| and
 			|t|.
 
 		e	When executing a register with ":@r", always add a
 			<CR> to the last line, also when the register is not
 			linewise.  If this flag is not present, the register
 			is not linewise and the last line does not end in a
 			<CR>, then the last line is put on the command-line
 			and can be edited before hitting <CR>.
 
 		E	It is an error when using "y", "d", "c", "g~", "gu" or
 			"gU" on an Empty region.  The operators only work when
 			at least one character is to be operated on.  Example:
 			This makes "y0" fail in the first column.
 
 		f	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
 			argument will set the file name for the current buffer,
 			if the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet.
 
 		F	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
 			argument will set the file name for the current
 			buffer, if the current buffer doesn't have a file name
 			yet.  Also see |cpo-P|.
 
 		i	When included, interrupting the reading of a file will
 			leave it modified.
 
 		I	When moving the cursor up or down just after inserting
 			indent for `'autoindent'` , do not delete the indent.
 
 		J	A |sentence| has to be followed by two spaces after
 			the `'.'` , `'!'`  or `'?'` .  A <Tab> is not recognized as
 			white space.
 
 		K	Don't wait for a key code to complete when it is
 			halfway through a mapping.  This breaks mapping
 			<F1><F1> when only part of the second <F1> has been
 			read.  It enables cancelling the mapping by typing
 			<F1><Esc>.
 
 		l	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
 			literally, only "\]", "\^", "\-" and "\\" are special.
 			See |/[]|
 			   `'l'`  included: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space>, `'\'`  and `'t'` 
 			   `'l'`  excluded: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space> and <Tab>
 
 		L	When the `'list'`  option is set, `'wrapmargin'` ,
 			`'textwidth'` , `'softtabstop'`  and Virtual Replace mode
 			(see |gR|) count a <Tab> as two characters, instead of
 			the normal behavior of a <Tab>.
 
 		m	When included, a showmatch will always wait half a
 			second.  When not included, a showmatch will wait half
 			a second or until a character is typed.  |`'showmatch'` |
 
 		M	When excluded, "%" matching will take backslashes into
 			account.  Thus in "( \( )" and "\( ( \)" the outer
 			parenthesis match.  When included "%" ignores
 			backslashes, which is Vi compatible.
 
 		n	When included, the column used for `'number'`  and
 			`'relativenumber'`  will also be used for text of wrapped
 			lines.
 
 		o	Line offset to search command is not remembered for
 			next search.
 
 		O	Don't complain if a file is being overwritten, even
 			when it didn't exist when editing it.  This is a
 			protection against a file unexpectedly created by
 			someone else.  Vi didn't complain about this.
 
 		p	Vi compatible Lisp indenting.  When not present, a
 			slightly better algorithm is used.
 
 		P	When included, a ":write" command that appends to a
 			file will set the file name for the current buffer, if
 			the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet and
 			the `'F'`  flag is also included |cpo-F|.
 
 		q	When joining multiple lines leave the cursor at the
 			position where it would be when joining two lines.
 
 		r	Redo ("." command) uses "/" to repeat a search
 			command, instead of the actually used search string.
 
 		R	Remove marks from filtered lines.  Without this flag
 			marks are kept like |:keepmarks| was used.
 
 		s	Set buffer options when entering the buffer for the
 			first time.  This is like it is in Vim version 3.0.
 			And it is the default.  If not present the options are
 			set when the buffer is created.
 
 		S	Set buffer options always when entering a buffer
 			(except `'readonly'` , `'fileformat'` , `'filetype'`  and
 			`'syntax'` ).  This is the (most) Vi compatible setting.
 			The options are set to the values in the current
 			buffer.  When you change an option and go to another
 			buffer, the value is copied.  Effectively makes the
 			buffer options global to all buffers.
 
 			`'s'`     `'S'`      copy buffer options
 			no     no      when buffer created
 			yes    no      when buffer first entered (default)
 			 X     yes     each time when buffer entered (vi comp.)
 
 		t	Search pattern for the tag command is remembered for
 			"n" command.  Otherwise Vim only puts the pattern in
 			the history for search pattern, but doesn't change the
 			last used search pattern.
 
 		u	Undo is Vi compatible.  See |undo-two-ways|.
 
 		v	Backspaced characters remain visible on the screen in
 			Insert mode.  Without this flag the characters are
 			erased from the screen right away.  With this flag the
 			screen newly typed text overwrites backspaced
 			characters.
 
 		W	Don't overwrite a readonly file.  When omitted, ":w!"
 			overwrites a readonly file, if possible.
 
 		x	<Esc> on the command-line executes the command-line.
 			The default in Vim is to abandon the command-line,
 			because <Esc> normally aborts a command.  |c_<Esc>|
 
 		X	When using a count with "R" the replaced text is
 			deleted only once.  Also when repeating "R" with "."
 			and a count.
 
 		y	A yank command can be redone with ".".  Think twice if
 			you really want to use this, it may break some
 			plugins, since most people expect "." to only repeat a
 			change.
 
 		Z	When using "w!" while the `'readonly'`  option is set,
 			don't reset `'readonly'` .
 
 		!	When redoing a filter command, use the last used
 			external command, whatever it was.  Otherwise the last
 			used -filter- command is used.
 
 		$	When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the
 			line, but put a `'$'`  at the end of the changed text.
 			The changed text will be overwritten when you type the
 			new text.  The line is redisplayed if you type any
 			command that moves the cursor from the insertion
 			point.
 
 		%	Vi-compatible matching is done for the "%" command.
 			Does not recognize "#if", "#endif", etc.
 			Does not recognize "/*" and "*/".
 			Parens inside single and double quotes are also
 			counted, causing a string that contains a paren to
 			disturb the matching.  For example, in a line like
 			"if (strcmp("foo(", s))" the first paren does not
 			match the last one.  When this flag is not included,
 			parens inside single and double quotes are treated
 			specially.  When matching a paren outside of quotes,
 			everything inside quotes is ignored.  When matching a
 			paren inside quotes, it will find the matching one (if
 			there is one).  This works very well for C programs.
 			This flag is also used for other features, such as
 			C-indenting.
 
 		+	When included, a ":write file" command will reset the
 			`'modified'`  flag of the buffer, even though the buffer
 			itself may still be different from its file.
 
 		>	When appending to a register, put a line break before
 			the appended text.
 
 		;	When using |,| or |;| to repeat the last |t| search
 			and the cursor is right in front of the searched
 			character, the cursor won't move. When not included,
 			the cursor would skip over it and jump to the
 			following occurrence.
 
 		_	When using |cw| on a word, do not include the
 			whitespace following the word in the motion.

# vim.opt.define

 `'define'`  `'def'` 		string	(default "^\sdefine")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Pattern to be used to find a macro definition.  It is a search
 	pattern, just like for the "/" command.  This option is used for the
 	commands like "[i" and "[d" |include-search|.  The `'isident'`  option is
 	used to recognize the defined name after the match:
 		{match with `'define'` }{non-ID chars}{defined name}{non-ID char}
 	See |option-backslash| about inserting backslashes to include a space
 	or backslash.
 	The default value is for C programs.  For C++ this value would be
 	useful, to include const type declarations: >
 		^\(#\s\s[a-z]*\)
 <	You can also use "\ze" just before the name and continue the pattern
 	to check what is following.  E.g. for Javascript, if a function is
 	defined with `func_name = function(args)`: >
 		^\s=\s*function(
 <	If the function is defined with `func_name : function() {...`: >
 	        ^\s[:]\sfunction\s*(
 <	When using the ":set" command, you need to double the backslashes!

# vim.opt.delcombine

 	"x" delete each combining character on its own.  When it is off (the
 	default) the character along with its combining characters are
 	deleted.
 	Note: When `'delcombine'`  is set "xx" may work differently from "2x"!

# vim.opt.dictionary

 `'dictionary'`  `'dict'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
 	for keyword completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|.  Each file should
 	contain a list of words.  This can be one word per line, or several
 	words per line, separated by non-keyword characters (white space is
 	preferred).  Maximum line length is 510 bytes.
 
 	When this option is empty or an entry "spell" is present, and spell
 	checking is enabled, words in the word lists for the currently active
 	`'spelllang'`  are used. See |spell|.
 
 	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
 	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
 	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
 	This has nothing to do with the |Dictionary| variable type.
 	Where to find a list of words?
 	- BSD/macOS include the "/usr/share/dict/words" file.
 	- Try "apt install spell" to get the "/usr/share/dict/words" file on
 	  apt-managed systems (Debian/Ubuntu).
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.
 	Backticks cannot be used in this option for security reasons.

# vim.opt.diffopt

 `'diffopt'`  `'dip'` 		string	(default "internal,filler,closeoff")
 			global
 	Option settings for diff mode.  It can consist of the following items.
 	All are optional.  Items must be separated by a comma.
 
 		filler		Show filler lines, to keep the text
 				synchronized with a window that has inserted
 				lines at the same position.  Mostly useful
 				when windows are side-by-side and `'scrollbind'` 
 				is set.
 
 		context:{n}	Use a context of {n} lines between a change
 				and a fold that contains unchanged lines.
 				When omitted a context of six lines is used.
 				When using zero the context is actually one,
 				since folds require a line in between, also
 				for a deleted line.
 				See |fold-diff|.
 
 		iblank		Ignore changes where lines are all blank.  Adds
 				the "-B" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.
 				NOTE: the diff windows will get out of sync,
 				because no differences between blank lines are
 				taken into account.
 
 		icase		Ignore changes in case of text.  "a" and "A"
 				are considered the same.  Adds the "-i" flag
 				to the "diff" command if `'diffexpr'`  is empty.
 
 		iwhite		Ignore changes in amount of white space.  Adds
 				the "-b" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.  It should ignore adding trailing
 				white space, but not leading white space.
 
 		iwhiteall	Ignore all white space changes.  Adds
 				the "-w" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.
 
 		iwhiteeol	Ignore white space changes at end of line.
 				Adds the "-Z" flag to the "diff" command if
 				`'diffexpr'`  is empty.  Check the documentation
 				of the "diff" command for what this does
 				exactly.
 
 		horizontal	Start diff mode with horizontal splits (unless
 				explicitly specified otherwise).
 
 		vertical	Start diff mode with vertical splits (unless
 				explicitly specified otherwise).
 
 		closeoff	When a window is closed where `'diff'`  is set
 				and there is only one window remaining in the
 				same tab page with `'diff'`  set, execute
 				`:diffoff` in that window.  This undoes a
 				`:diffsplit` command.
 
 		hiddenoff	Do not use diff mode for a buffer when it
 				becomes hidden.
 
 		foldcolumn:{n}	Set the `'foldcolumn'`  option to {n} when
 				starting diff mode.  Without this 2 is used.
 
 		followwrap	Follow the `'wrap'`  option and leave as it is.
 
 		internal	Use the internal diff library.  This is
 				ignored when `'diffexpr'`  is set.
 				When running out of memory when writing a
 				buffer this item will be ignored for diffs
 				involving that buffer.  Set the `'verbose'` 
 				option to see when this happens.
 
 		indent-heuristic
 				Use the indent heuristic for the internal
 				diff library.
 
 		linematch:{n}   Enable a second stage diff on each generated
 				hunk in order to align lines. When the total
 				number of lines in a hunk exceeds {n}, the
 				second stage diff will not be performed as
 				very large hunks can cause noticeable lag. A
 				recommended setting is "linematch:60", as this
 				will enable alignment for a 2 buffer diff with
 				hunks of up to 30 lines each, or a 3 buffer
 				diff with hunks of up to 20 lines each.
 
                 algorithm:{text} Use the specified diff algorithm with the
 				internal diff engine. Currently supported
 				algorithms are:
 				myers      the default algorithm
 				minimal    spend extra time to generate the
 					   smallest possible diff
 				patience   patience diff algorithm
 				histogram  histogram diff algorithm
 
 	Examples: >
 		:set diffopt=internal,filler,context:4
 		:set diffopt=
 		:set diffopt=internal,filler,foldcolumn:3
 		:set diffopt-=internal  " do NOT use the internal diff parser

# vim.opt.directory

 `'directory'`  `'dir'` 	string	(default "$XDG_STATE_HOME/nvim/swap//")
 			global
 	List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.
 
 	Possible items:
 	- The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
 	  possible.  If it is not possible in any directory, but last
 	  directory listed in the option does not exist, it is created.
 	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
 	  impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
 	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
 	  the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading "."
 	  is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
 	  with all path separators replaced by percent `'%'`  signs (including
 	  the colon following the drive letter on Win32). This will ensure
 	  file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
 	  use `'//'` , instead of `'\\'` .
 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
 	- A directory name may end in an `':'`  or `'/'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type one before a space, type two to
 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
 	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
 <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a `'>'`  at the start
 	  of the option is removed.
 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
 	choice than "/tmp".  But others on the computer may be able to see the
 	files, and it can contain a lot of files, your swap files get lost in
 	the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your home directory is
 	tried first.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing

# vim.opt.display

 `'display'`  `'dy'` 		string	(default "lastline")
 			global
 	Change the way text is displayed.  This is a comma-separated list of
 	flags:
 	lastline	When included, as much as possible of the last line
 			in a window will be displayed.  "@@@" is put in the
 			last columns of the last screen line to indicate the
 			rest of the line is not displayed.
 	truncate	Like "lastline", but "@@@" is displayed in the first
 			column of the last screen line.  Overrules "lastline".
 	uhex		Show unprintable characters hexadecimal as <xx>
 			instead of using ^C and ~C.
 	msgsep		Obsolete flag. Allowed but takes no effect. |msgsep|
 
 	When neither "lastline" nor "truncate" is included, a last line that
 	doesn't fit is replaced with "@" lines.
 
 	The "@" character can be changed by setting the "lastline" item in
 	`'fillchars'` .  The character is highlighted with |hl-NonText|.

# vim.opt.equalalways

 			global
 	When on, all the windows are automatically made the same size after
 	splitting or closing a window.  This also happens the moment the
 	option is switched on.  When off, splitting a window will reduce the
 	size of the current window and leave the other windows the same.  When
 	closing a window the extra lines are given to the window next to it
 	(depending on `'splitbelow'`  and `'splitright'` ).
 	When mixing vertically and horizontally split windows, a minimal size
 	is computed and some windows may be larger if there is room.  The
 	`'eadirection'`  option tells in which direction the size is affected.
 	Changing the height and width of a window can be avoided by setting
 	`'winfixheight'`  and `'winfixwidth'` , respectively.
 	If a window size is specified when creating a new window sizes are

# vim.opt.fileencoding

 `'fileencoding'`  `'fenc'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to buffer
 	File-content encoding for the current buffer. Conversion is done with
 	iconv() or as specified with `'charconvert'` .
 
 	When `'fileencoding'`  is not UTF-8, conversion will be done when
 	writing the file.  For reading see below.
 	When `'fileencoding'`  is empty, the file will be saved with UTF-8
 	encoding (no conversion when reading or writing a file).
 
 	WARNING: Conversion to a non-Unicode encoding can cause loss of
 	information!
 
 	See |encoding-names| for the possible values.  Additionally, values may be
 	specified that can be handled by the converter, see
 	|mbyte-conversion|.
 
 	When reading a file `'fileencoding'`  will be set from `'fileencodings'` .
 	To read a file in a certain encoding it won't work by setting
 	`'fileencoding'` , use the |++enc| argument.  One exception: when
 	`'fileencodings'`  is empty the value of `'fileencoding'`  is used.
 	For a new file the global value of `'fileencoding'`  is used.
 
 	Prepending "8bit-" and "2byte-" has no meaning here, they are ignored.
 	When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
 	you can set it with uppercase values too.  `'_'`  characters are
 	replaced with `'-'` .  If a name is recognized from the list at
 	|encoding-names|, it is replaced by the standard name.  For example
 	"ISO8859-2" becomes "iso-8859-2".
 
 	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the `'modified'` 
 	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
 
 	Keep in mind that changing `'fenc'`  from a modeline happens
 	AFTER the text has been read, thus it applies to when the file will be
 	written.  If you do set `'fenc'`  in a modeline, you might want to set
 	`'nomodified'`  to avoid not being able to ":q".
 
 	This option cannot be changed when `'modifiable'`  is off.

# vim.opt.fileencodings

 `'fileencodings'`  `'fencs'` 	string (default: "ucs-bom,utf-8,default,latin1")
 			global
 	This is a list of character encodings considered when starting to edit
 	an existing file.  When a file is read, Vim tries to use the first
 	mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one
 	in the list is tried.  When an encoding is found that works,
 	`'fileencoding'`  is set to it.  If all fail, `'fileencoding'`  is set to
 	an empty string, which means that UTF-8 is used.
 		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use
 		the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
 		that can't be converted.
 	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
 	will work and the first entry of `'fileencodings'`  will be used (except
 	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
 	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
 	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
 		au BufReadPost * if search(`'\S'` , `'w'` ) == 0 |
 			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
 <	This sets `'fileencoding'`  to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
 	non-blank characters.
 	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of `'fileencodings'`  is
 	not used.
 	Note that `'fileencodings'`  is not used for a new file, the global value
 	of `'fileencoding'`  is used instead.  You can set it with: >
 		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
 <	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
 	an empty file.
 	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
 	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
 	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
 	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
 	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
 	accepted.
 	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
 	environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
 	encoding, such as Russian.
 	When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be
 	recognized as "utf-8".  You can use the |8g8| command to find the
 	illegal byte sequence.
 	WRONG VALUES:			WHAT'S WRONG:
 		latin1,utf-8		"latin1" will always be used
 		utf-8,ucs-bom,latin1	BOM won't be recognized in an utf-8
 					file
 		cp1250,latin1		"cp1250" will always be used
 	If `'fileencodings'`  is empty, `'fileencoding'`  is not modified.
 	See `'fileencoding'`  for the possible values.
 	Setting this option does not have an effect until the next time a file
 	is read.

# vim.opt.fileformat

 	When "dos" is used, CTRL-Z at the end of a file is ignored.

# vim.opt.fileformats

 `'fileformats'`  `'ffs'` 	string (default:
 				Win32: "dos,unix",
 				Unix: "unix,dos")
 			global
 	This gives the end-of-line (<EOL>) formats that will be tried when
 	starting to edit a new buffer and when reading a file into an existing
 	buffer:
 	- When empty, the format defined with `'fileformat'`  will be used
 	  always.  It is not set automatically.
 	- When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
 	  is opened.  `'fileformat'`  is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
 	  `'fileformats'`  name will be used when a file is read into an existing
 	  buffer, no matter what `'fileformat'`  for that buffer is set to.
 	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
 	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
 	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
 	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and `'fileformats'`  includes "dos",
 	     `'fileformat'`  is set to "dos".
 	  2. If a <NL> is found and `'fileformats'`  includes "unix", `'fileformat'` 
 	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
 	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
 	  3. If `'fileformat'`  has not yet been set, and if a <CR> is found, and
 	     if `'fileformats'`  includes "mac", `'fileformat'`  is set to "mac".
 	     This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
 	      "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
 	      "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
 	     Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
 	     the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
 	     the first few lines, "mac" is used.
 	  4. If `'fileformat'`  is still not set, the first name from
 	     `'fileformats'`  is used.
 	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
 	  this happens like `'fileformat'`  has been set appropriately for that
 	  file only, the option is not changed.
 	When `'binary'`  is set, the value of `'fileformats'`  is not used.
 
 	When Vim starts up with an empty buffer the first item is used.  You
 	can overrule this by setting `'fileformat'`  in your .vimrc.
 
 	For systems with a Dos-like <EOL> (<CR><NL>), when reading files that
 	are ":source"ed and for vimrc files, automatic <EOL> detection may be
 	done:
 	- When `'fileformats'`  is empty, there is no automatic detection.  Dos
 	  format will be used.
 	- When `'fileformats'`  is set to one or more names, automatic detection
 	  is done.  This is based on the first <NL> in the file: If there is a
 	  <CR> in front of it, Dos format is used, otherwise Unix format is
 	  used.
 	Also see |file-formats|.

# vim.opt.filetype

 	When this option is set, the FileType autocommand event is triggered.

 	name.
 	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current file type.
 	This option is normally set when the file type is detected.  To enable

 	Setting this option to a different value is most useful in a modeline,
 	for a file for which the file type is not automatically recognized.
 	Example, for in an IDL file: >
 		/* vim: set filetype=idl : */
 <	|FileType| |filetypes|
 	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
 	names.  Example: >
 		/* vim: set filetype=c.doxygen : */
 <	This will use the "c" filetype first, then the "doxygen" filetype.
 	This works both for filetype plugins and for syntax files.  More than
 	one dot may appear.
 	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the `'s'`  or
 	`'S'`  flag in `'cpoptions'` .
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

# vim.opt.fillchars

 `'fillchars'`  `'fcs'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Characters to fill the statuslines, vertical separators and special
 	lines in the window.
 	It is a comma-separated list of items.  Each item has a name, a colon
 	and the value of that item:
 
 	  item		default		Used for ~
 	  stl		' ' or `'^'` 	statusline of the current window
 	  stlnc		' ' or `'='` 	statusline of the non-current windows
 	  wbr		' '		window bar
 	  horiz		`'─'`  or `'-'` 	horizontal separators |:split|
 	  horizup	`'┴'`  or `'-'` 	upwards facing horizontal separator
 	  horizdown	`'┬'`  or `'-'` 	downwards facing horizontal separator
 	  vert		`'│'`  or `'|'` 	vertical separators |:vsplit|
 	  vertleft	`'┤'`  or `'|'` 	left facing vertical separator
 	  vertright	`'├'`  or `'|'` 	right facing vertical separator
 	  verthoriz	`'┼'`  or `'+'` 	overlapping vertical and horizontal
 					separator
 	  fold		`'·'`  or `'-'` 	filling `'foldtext'` 
 	  foldopen	`'-'` 		mark the beginning of a fold
 	  foldclose	`'+'` 		show a closed fold
 	  foldsep	`'│'`  or `'|'`       open fold middle marker
 	  diff		`'-'` 		deleted lines of the `'diff'`  option
 	  msgsep	' '		message separator `'display'` 
 	  eob		`'~'` 		empty lines at the end of a buffer
 	  lastline	`'@'` 		`'display'`  contains lastline/truncate
 
 	Any one that is omitted will fall back to the default.  For "stl" and
 	"stlnc" the space will be used when there is highlighting, `'^'`  or `'='` 
 	otherwise.
 
 	Note that "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown", "vertleft", "vertright" and
 	"verthoriz" are only used when `'laststatus'`  is 3, since only vertical
 	window separators are used otherwise.
 
 	If `'ambiwidth'`  is "double" then "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown",
 	"vert", "vertleft", "vertright", "verthoriz", "foldsep" and "fold"
 	default to single-byte alternatives.
 
 	Example: >
 	    :set fillchars=stl:^,stlnc:=,vert:│,fold:·,diff:-
 <	This is similar to the default, except that these characters will also
 	be used when there is highlighting.
 
 	For the "stl", "stlnc", "foldopen", "foldclose" and "foldsep" items
 	single-byte and multibyte characters are supported.  But double-width
 	characters are not supported.
 
 	The highlighting used for these items:
 	  item		highlight group ~
 	  stl		StatusLine		|hl-StatusLine|
 	  stlnc		StatusLineNC		|hl-StatusLineNC|
 	  wbr		WinBar			|hl-WinBar| or |hl-WinBarNC|
 	  horiz		WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  horizup	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  horizdown	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  vert		WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  vertleft	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  vertright	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  verthoriz	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  fold		Folded			|hl-Folded|
 	  diff		DiffDelete		|hl-DiffDelete|
 	  eob		EndOfBuffer		|hl-EndOfBuffer|
 	  lastline	NonText			|hl-NonText|

 	one a fold can only be closed if it takes up two or more screen lines.
 	Set to zero to be able to close folds of just one screen line.
 	Note that this only has an effect on what is displayed.  After using

# vim.opt.foldopen

 `'foldopen'`  `'fdo'` 	string (default: "block,hor,mark,percent,quickfix,

 			global
 	Specifies for which type of commands folds will be opened, if the
 	command moves the cursor into a closed fold.  It is a comma-separated
 	list of items.
 	NOTE: When the command is part of a mapping this option is not used.
 	Add the |zv| command to the mapping to get the same effect.
 	(rationale: the mapping may want to control opening folds itself)
 
 		item		commands ~
 		all		any
 		block		"(", "{", "[[", "[{", etc.
 		hor		horizontal movements: "l", "w", "fx", etc.
 		insert		any command in Insert mode
 		jump		far jumps: "G", "gg", etc.
 		mark		jumping to a mark: "'m", CTRL-O, etc.
 		percent		"%"
 		quickfix	":cn", ":crew", ":make", etc.
 		search		search for a pattern: "/", "n", "*", "gd", etc.
 				(not for a search pattern in a ":" command)
 				Also for |[s| and |]s|.
 		tag		jumping to a tag: ":ta", CTRL-T, etc.
 		undo		undo or redo: "u" and CTRL-R
 	When a movement command is used for an operator (e.g., "dl" or "y%")
 	this option is not used.  This means the operator will include the
 	whole closed fold.
 	Note that vertical movements are not here, because it would make it
 	very difficult to move onto a closed fold.
 	In insert mode the folds containing the cursor will always be open
 	when text is inserted.
 	To close folds you can re-apply `'foldlevel'`  with the |zx| command or

# vim.opt.formatexpr

 `'formatexpr'`  `'fex'` 	string (default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression which is evaluated to format a range of lines for the |gq|
 	operator or automatic formatting (see `'formatoptions'` ).  When this
 	option is empty `'formatprg'`  is used.
 
 	The |v:lnum|  variable holds the first line to be formatted.
 	The |v:count| variable holds the number of lines to be formatted.
 	The |v:char|  variable holds the character that is going to be
 		      inserted if the expression is being evaluated due to
 		      automatic formatting.  This can be empty.  Don't insert
 		      it yet!
 
 	Example: >
 		:set formatexpr=mylang#Format()
 <	This will invoke the mylang#Format() function in the
 	autoload/mylang.vim file in `'runtimepath'` . |autoload|
 
 	The expression is also evaluated when `'textwidth'`  is set and adding
 	text beyond that limit.  This happens under the same conditions as
 	when internal formatting is used.  Make sure the cursor is kept in the
 	same spot relative to the text then!  The |mode()| function will
 	return "i" or "R" in this situation.
 
 	When the expression evaluates to non-zero Vim will fall back to using
 	the internal format mechanism.
 
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set formatexpr=s:MyFormatExpr()
 		set formatexpr=<SID>SomeFormatExpr()
 <
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.  That stops the option from working,
 	since changing the buffer text is not allowed.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 	NOTE: This option is set to "" when `'compatible'`  is set.

# vim.opt.grepprg

 	Program to use for the |:grep| command.  This option may contain `'%'` 
 	and `'#'`  characters, which are expanded like when used in a command-
 	line.  The placeholder "$*" is allowed to specify where the arguments
 	will be included.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See
 	|option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	When your "grep" accepts the "-H" argument, use this to make ":grep"
 	also work well with a single file: >
 		:set grepprg=grep\ -nH
 <	Special value: When `'grepprg'`  is set to "internal" the |:grep| command
 	works like |:vimgrep|, |:lgrep| like |:lvimgrep|, |:grepadd| like
 	|:vimgrepadd| and |:lgrepadd| like |:lvimgrepadd|.
 	See also the section |:make_makeprg|, since most of the comments there

# vim.opt.guicursor

 `'guicursor'`  `'gcr'` 	string	(default "n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr-o:hor20")
 			global
 	Configures the cursor style for each mode. Works in the GUI and many
 	terminals.  See |tui-cursor-shape|.
 
 	To disable cursor-styling, reset the option: >
 		:set guicursor=
 
 <	To enable mode shapes, "Cursor" highlight, and blinking: >
 		:set guicursor=n-v-c:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr:hor20,o:hor50
 		  \,a:blinkwait700-blinkoff400-blinkon250-Cursor/lCursor
 		  \,sm:block-blinkwait175-blinkoff150-blinkon175
 
 <	The option is a comma-separated list of parts.  Each part consists of a
 	mode-list and an argument-list:
 		mode-list:argument-list,mode-list:argument-list,..
 	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes:
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		ve	Visual mode with `'selection'`  "exclusive" (same as `'v'` ,
 			if not specified)
 		o	Operator-pending mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		r	Replace mode
 		c	Command-line Normal (append) mode
 		ci	Command-line Insert mode
 		cr	Command-line Replace mode
 		sm	showmatch in Insert mode
 		a	all modes
 	The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
 		hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
 		ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
 		block	block cursor, fills the whole character
 			- Only one of the above three should be present.
 			- Default is "block" for each mode.
 		blinkwait{N}
 		blinkon{N}
 		blinkoff{N}
 			blink times for cursor: blinkwait is the delay before
 			the cursor starts blinking, blinkon is the time that
 			the cursor is shown and blinkoff is the time that the
 			cursor is not shown.  Times are in msec.  When one of
 			the numbers is zero, there is no blinking. E.g.: >
 				:set guicursor=n:blinkon0
 <			- Default is "blinkon0" for each mode.
 		{group-name}
 			Highlight group that decides the color and font of the
 			cursor.
 			In the |TUI|:
 			- |inverse|/reverse and no group-name are interpreted
 			  as "host-terminal default cursor colors" which
 			  typically means "inverted bg and fg colors".
 			- |ctermfg| and |guifg| are ignored.
 		{group-name}/{group-name}
 			Two highlight group names, the first is used when
 			no language mappings are used, the other when they
 			are. |language-mapping|
 
 	Examples of parts:
 	   n-c-v:block-nCursor	In Normal, Command-line and Visual mode, use a
 				block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
 				highlight group
 	   n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25-Cursor,r-cr-o:hor20
 				In Normal et al. modes, use a block cursor
 				with the default colors defined by the host
 				terminal.  In Insert-likes modes, use
 				a vertical bar cursor with colors from
 				"Cursor" highlight group.  In Replace-likes
 				modes, use a underline cursor with
 				default colors.
 	   i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
 				In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
 				30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
 				"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
 				faster.
 
 	The `'a'`  mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
 	all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
 	to do a common setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
 	blinking: "a:blinkon0"
 
 	Examples of cursor highlighting: >
 	    :highlight Cursor gui=reverse guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
 	    :highlight Cursor gui=NONE guifg=bg guibg=fg

# vim.opt.guifont

 `'guifont'`  `'gfn'` 		string	(default "")
 			global
 	This is a list of fonts which will be used for the GUI version of Vim.
 	In its simplest form the value is just one font name.  When
 	the font cannot be found you will get an error message.  To try other
 	font names a list can be specified, font names separated with commas.
 	The first valid font is used.
 
 	Spaces after a comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name
 	precede it with a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra
 	backslash before a space and a backslash.  See also
 	|option-backslash|.  For example: >
 	    :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
 <	will make Vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails it
 	will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.
 
 	If none of the fonts can be loaded, Vim will keep the current setting.
 	If an empty font list is given, Vim will try using other resource
 	settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
 	will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
 	the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
 	will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.
 
 	For Win32 and Mac OS: >
 	    :set guifont=*
 <	will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.
 
 	The font name depends on the GUI used.
 
 	For Mac OSX you can use something like this: >
 	    :set guifont=Monaco:h10
 <
 	Note that the fonts must be mono-spaced (all characters have the same
 	width).
 
 	To preview a font on X11, you might be able to use the "xfontsel"
 	program.  The "xlsfonts" program gives a list of all available fonts.
 
 	For the Win32 GUI
 	- takes these options in the font name:
 		hXX - height is XX (points, can be floating-point)
 		wXX - width is XX (points, can be floating-point)
 		b   - bold
 		i   - italic
 		u   - underline
 		s   - strikeout
 		cXX - character set XX.  Valid charsets are: ANSI, ARABIC,
 		      BALTIC, CHINESEBIG5, DEFAULT, EASTEUROPE, GB2312, GREEK,
 		      HANGEUL, HEBREW, JOHAB, MAC, OEM, RUSSIAN, SHIFTJIS,
 		      SYMBOL, THAI, TURKISH, VIETNAMESE ANSI and BALTIC.
 		      Normally you would use "cDEFAULT".
 
 	  Use a `':'`  to separate the options.
 	- A `'_'`  can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
 	  backslashes to escape the spaces.
 	- Examples: >
 	    :set guifont=courier_new:h12:w5:b:cRUSSIAN
 	    :set guifont=Andale_Mono:h7.5:w4.5

# vim.opt.guioptions

 `'guioptions'`  `'go'` 	string	(default "egmrLT"   (MS-Windows))
 			global
 	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim.  It is a
 	sequence of letters which describes what components and options of the
 	GUI should be used.
 	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
 	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
 
 	Valid letters are as follows:
 
 	  `'a'` 	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
 		or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
 		the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
 		Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
 		applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
 		ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
 		application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
 		is automatically yanked into the "* selection register.
 		Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
 		applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
 		    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
 		windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
 		by a yank or delete operation for the "* register.
 		The same applies to the modeless selection.
 
 	  `'P'` 	Like autoselect but using the "+ register instead of the "*
 		register.
 
 	  `'A'` 	Autoselect for the modeless selection.  Like `'a'` , but only
 		applies to the modeless selection.
 
 		    `'guioptions'`    autoselect Visual  autoselect modeless ~
 			 ""		 -			 -
 			 "a"		yes			yes
 			 "A"		 -			yes
 			 "aA"		yes			yes
 
 
 	  `'c'` 	Use console dialogs instead of popup dialogs for simple
 		choices.
 
 	  `'d'` 	Use dark theme variant if available.
 
 	  `'e'` 	Add tab pages when indicated with `'showtabline'` .
 		`'guitablabel'`  can be used to change the text in the labels.
 		When `'e'`  is missing a non-GUI tab pages line may be used.
 		The GUI tabs are only supported on some systems, currently
 		Mac OS/X and MS-Windows.
 
 	  `'i'` 	Use a Vim icon.
 
 	  `'m'` 	Menu bar is present.
 
 	  `'M'` 	The system menu "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim" is not sourced.  Note
 		that this flag must be added in the vimrc file, before
 		switching on syntax or filetype recognition (when the |gvimrc|
 		file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded; the
 		`:syntax on` and `:filetype on` commands load the menu too).
 
 	  `'g'` 	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
 		`'g'`  is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.
 
 	  `'T'` 	Include Toolbar.  Currently only in Win32 GUI.
 
 	  `'r'` 	Right-hand scrollbar is always present.
 
 	  `'R'` 	Right-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
 		split window.
 
 	  `'l'` 	Left-hand scrollbar is always present.
 
 	  `'L'` 	Left-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
 		split window.
 
 	  `'b'` 	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present.  Its size depends on
 		the longest visible line, or on the cursor line if the `'h'` 
 		flag is included. |gui-horiz-scroll|
 
 	  `'h'` 	Limit horizontal scrollbar size to the length of the cursor
 		line.  Reduces computations. |gui-horiz-scroll|
 
 	And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
 	you really want to :-).  See |gui-scrollbars| for more information.
 
 
 	  `'v'` 	Use a vertical button layout for dialogs.  When not included,
 		a horizontal layout is preferred, but when it doesn't fit a
 		vertical layout is used anyway.  Not supported in GTK 3.
 
 	  `'p'` 	Use Pointer callbacks for X11 GUI.  This is required for some
 		window managers.  If the cursor is not blinking or hollow at
 		the right moment, try adding this flag.  This must be done
 		before starting the GUI.  Set it in your |gvimrc|.  Adding or
 		removing it after the GUI has started has no effect.
 
 	  `'k'` 	Keep the GUI window size when adding/removing a scrollbar, or
 		toolbar, tabline, etc.  Instead, the behavior is similar to
 		when the window is maximized and will adjust `'lines'`  and
 		`'columns'`  to fit to the window.  Without the `'k'`  flag Vim will
 		try to keep `'lines'`  and `'columns'`  the same when adding and
 		removing GUI components.

# vim.opt.hlsearch

 `'hlsearch'`  `'hls'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches.
 	The |hl-Search| highlight group determines the highlighting for all
 	matches not under the cursor while the |hl-CurSearch| highlight group
 	(if defined) determines the highlighting for the match under the
 	cursor. If |hl-CurSearch| is not defined, then |hl-Search| is used for
 	both. Note that only the matching text is highlighted, any offsets
 	are not applied.
 	See also: `'incsearch'`  and |:match|.
 	When you get bored looking at the highlighted matches, you can turn it
 	off with |:nohlsearch|.  This does not change the option value, as
 	soon as you use a search command, the highlighting comes back.
 	`'redrawtime'`  specifies the maximum time spent on finding matches.
 	When the search pattern can match an end-of-line, Vim will try to
 	highlight all of the matched text.  However, this depends on where the
 	search starts.  This will be the first line in the window or the first
 	line below a closed fold.  A match in a previous line which is not
 	drawn may not continue in a newly drawn line.
 	You can specify whether the highlight status is restored on startup
 	with the `'h'`  flag in `'shada'`  |shada-h|.

 	value is for C programs.  This option is used for the commands "[i",
 	"]I", "[d", etc.
 	Normally the `'isfname'`  option is used to recognize the file name that
 	comes after the matched pattern.  But if "\zs" appears in the pattern
 	then the text matched from "\zs" to the end, or until "\ze" if it
 	appears, is used as the file name.  Use this to include characters
 	that are not in `'isfname'` , such as a space.  You can then use
 	`'includeexpr'`  to process the matched text.

# vim.opt.includeexpr

 `'includeexpr'`  `'inex'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression to be used to transform the string found with the `'include'` 
 	option to a file name.  Mostly useful to change "." to "/" for Java: >
 		:setlocal includeexpr=substitute(v:fname,`'\\.'` ,`'/'` ,`'g'` )
 <	The "v:fname" variable will be set to the file name that was detected.
 	Note the double backslash: the `:set` command first halves them, then
 	one remains in the value, where "\." matches a dot literally.  For
 	simple character replacements `tr()` avoids the need for escaping: >
 		:setlocal includeexpr=tr(v:fname,`'.'` ,`'/'` )
 <
 	Also used for the |gf| command if an unmodified file name can't be
 	found.  Allows doing "gf" on the name after an `'include'`  statement.
 	Also used for |<cfile>|.
 
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set includeexpr=s:MyIncludeExpr(v:fname)
 		set includeexpr=<SID>SomeIncludeExpr(v:fname)
 <
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'includeexpr'`  |textlock|.

# vim.opt.incsearch

 `'incsearch'`  `'is'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed
 	so far, matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the pattern
 	is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will be updated
 	often, this is only useful on fast terminals.
 	Note that the match will be shown, but the cursor will return to its
 	original position when no match is found and when pressing <Esc>.  You
 	still need to finish the search command with <Enter> to move the
 	cursor to the match.
 	You can use the CTRL-G and CTRL-T keys to move to the next and
 	previous match. |c_CTRL-G| |c_CTRL-T|
 	Vim only searches for about half a second.  With a complicated
 	pattern and/or a lot of text the match may not be found.  This is to
 	avoid that Vim hangs while you are typing the pattern.
 	The |hl-IncSearch| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	When `'hlsearch'`  is on, all matched strings are highlighted too while
 	typing a search command. See also: `'hlsearch'` .
 	If you don't want to turn `'hlsearch'`  on, but want to highlight all
 	matches while searching, you can turn on and off `'hlsearch'`  with
 	autocmd.  Example: >
 		augroup vimrc-incsearch-highlight
 		  autocmd!
 		  autocmd CmdlineEnter /,\? :set hlsearch
 		  autocmd CmdlineLeave /,\? :set nohlsearch
 		augroup END
 <
 	CTRL-L can be used to add one character from after the current match
 	to the command line.  If `'ignorecase'`  and `'smartcase'`  are set and the
 	command line has no uppercase characters, the added character is
 	converted to lowercase.
 	CTRL-R CTRL-W can be used to add the word at the end of the current
 	match, excluding the characters that were already typed.

# vim.opt.indentexpr

 `'indentexpr'`  `'inde'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to buffer
 	Expression which is evaluated to obtain the proper indent for a line.
 	It is used when a new line is created, for the |=| operator and
 	in Insert mode as specified with the `'indentkeys'`  option.
 	When this option is not empty, it overrules the `'cindent'`  and
 	`'smartindent'`  indenting.  When `'lisp'`  is set, this option is
 	is only used when `'lispoptions'`  contains "expr:1".
 	The expression is evaluated with |v:lnum| set to the line number for
 	which the indent is to be computed.  The cursor is also in this line
 	when the expression is evaluated (but it may be moved around).
 	If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with
 	the script ID (|local-function|). Example: >
 		set indentexpr=s:MyIndentExpr()
 		set indentexpr=<SID>SomeIndentExpr()
 <
 	The expression must return the number of spaces worth of indent.  It
 	can return "-1" to keep the current indent (this means `'autoindent'`  is
 	used for the indent).
 	Functions useful for computing the indent are |indent()|, |cindent()|
 	and |lispindent()|.
 	The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!  It must
 	not change the text, jump to another window, etc.  Afterwards the
 	cursor position is always restored, thus the cursor may be moved.
 	Normally this option would be set to call a function: >
 		:set indentexpr=GetMyIndent()
 <	Error messages will be suppressed, unless the `'debug'`  option contains
 	"msg".
 	See |indent-expression|.
 
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.

# vim.opt.isfname

 `'isfname'`  `'isf'` 		string	(default for Windows:
 			     "@,48-57,/,\,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,{,},[,],:,@-@,!,~,="
 			    otherwise: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=")
 			global
 	The characters specified by this option are included in file names and
 	path names.  Filenames are used for commands like "gf", "[i" and in
 	the tags file.  It is also used for "\f" in a |pattern|.
 	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
 	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.
 	For UTF-8 the characters 0xa0 to 0xff are included as well.
 	Think twice before adding white space to this option.  Although a
 	space may appear inside a file name, the effect will be that Vim
 	doesn't know where a file name starts or ends when doing completion.
 	It most likely works better without a space in `'isfname'` .
 
 	Note that on systems using a backslash as path separator, Vim tries to
 	do its best to make it work as you would expect.  That is a bit
 	tricky, since Vi originally used the backslash to escape special
 	characters.  Vim will not remove a backslash in front of a normal file
 	name character on these systems, but it will on Unix and alikes.  The
 	`'&'`  and `'^'`  are not included by default, because these are special for
 	cmd.exe.
 
 	The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
 	Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
 	character numbers with `'-'`  in between.  A character number can be a
 	decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
 	not work for digits).  Example:
 		"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include `'_'`  and `'-'`  and the range
 					128 to 140 and `'#'`  to 43)
 	If a part starts with `'^'` , the following character number or range
 	will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
 	to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
 	included.  To include `'^'`  itself use it as the last character of the
 	option or the end of a range.  Example:
 		"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude `'a'`  to `'z'` , include `'#'`  and `'^'` )
 	If the character is `'@'` , all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
 	are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
 	plus accented characters.  To include `'@'`  itself use "@-@".  Examples:
 		"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
 				case ASCII letters.
 		"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the `'@'`  character.
 	A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
 	expected.  Example:
 		"48-57,,,_"	Digits, comma and underscore.
 	A comma can be excluded by prepending a `'^'` .  Example:
 		" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to `'~'` , excluding
 				comma, plus <Tab>.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

 	|pattern|.  See `'isfname'`  for a description of the format of this
 	option.  For `'@'`  only characters up to 255 are used.
 	Careful: If you change this option, it might break expanding

 	characters above 255 check the "word" character class (any character
 	that is not white space or punctuation).

# vim.opt.langmap

 `'langmap'`  `'lmap'` 	string	(default "")
 			global
 	This option allows switching your keyboard into a special language
 	mode.  When you are typing text in Insert mode the characters are
 	inserted directly.  When in Normal mode the `'langmap'`  option takes
 	care of translating these special characters to the original meaning
 	of the key.  This means you don't have to change the keyboard mode to
 	be able to execute Normal mode commands.
 	This is the opposite of the `'keymap'`  option, where characters are
 	mapped in Insert mode.
 	Also consider setting `'langremap'`  to off, to prevent `'langmap'`  from
 	applying to characters resulting from a mapping.
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.
 
 	Example (for Greek, in UTF-8):				  >
 	    :set langmap=ΑA,ΒB,ΨC,ΔD,ΕE,ΦF,ΓG,ΗH,ΙI,ΞJ,ΚK,ΛL,ΜM,ΝN,ΟO,ΠP,QQ,ΡR,ΣS,ΤT,ΘU,ΩV,WW,ΧX,ΥY,ΖZ,αa,βb,ψc,δd,εe,φf,γg,ηh,ιi,ξj,κk,λl,μm,νn,οo,πp,qq,ρr,σs,τt,θu,ωv,ςw,χx,υy,ζz
 <	Example (exchanges meaning of z and y for commands): >
 	    :set langmap=zy,yz,ZY,YZ
 <
 	The `'langmap'`  option is a list of parts, separated with commas.  Each
 	part can be in one of two forms:
 	1.  A list of pairs.  Each pair is a "from" character immediately
 	    followed by the "to" character.  Examples: "aA", "aAbBcC".
 	2.  A list of "from" characters, a semi-colon and a list of "to"
 	    characters.  Example: "abc;ABC"
 	Example: "aA,fgh;FGH,cCdDeE"
 	Special characters need to be preceded with a backslash.  These are
 	";", `','` , `'"'` , `'|'`  and backslash itself.
 
 	This will allow you to activate vim actions without having to switch
 	back and forth between the languages.  Your language characters will
 	be understood as normal vim English characters (according to the
 	langmap mappings) in the following cases:
 	 o Normal/Visual mode (commands, buffer/register names, user mappings)
 	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Register names after CTRL-R
 	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Mappings
 	Characters entered in Command-line mode will NOT be affected by
 	this option.   Note that this option can be changed at any time
 	allowing to switch between mappings for different languages/encodings.
 	Use a mapping to avoid having to type it each time!

 	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.
 	If `'breakindent'`  is set, line is visually indented. Then, the value
 	of `'showbreak'`  is used to put in front of wrapped lines. This option
 	is not used when the `'wrap'`  option is off.

# vim.opt.lines

 	Normally you don't need to set this.  It is done automatically by the

 	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
 	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
 	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |gvimrc| file.
 	Vim limits the number of lines to what fits on the screen.  You can

 	When non-zero there is room for underlining.
 	With some fonts there can be too much room between lines (to have
 	space for ascents and descents).  Then it makes sense to set

 	"cc" or "S".  `'autoindent'`  must also be on for this to work.  The `'p'`

 	better.  Also see `'lispwords'` .

 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Strings to use in `'list'`  mode and for the |:list| command.  It is a
 	comma-separated list of string settings.
 
 
 	  eol:c		Character to show at the end of each line.  When
 			omitted, there is no extra character at the end of the
 			line.
 
 	  tab:xy[z]	Two or three characters to be used to show a tab.
 			The third character is optional.
 
 	  tab:xy	The `'x'`  is always used, then `'y'`  as many times as will
 			fit.  Thus "tab:>-" displays: >
 				>
 				>-
 				>--
 				etc.
 <
 	  tab:xyz	The `'z'`  is always used, then `'x'`  is prepended, and
 			then `'y'`  is used as many times as will fit.  Thus
 			"tab:<->" displays: >
 				>
 				<>
 				<->
 				<-->
 				etc.
 <
 			When "tab:" is omitted, a tab is shown as ^I.
 
 	  space:c	Character to show for a space.  When omitted, spaces
 			are left blank.
 
 	  multispace:c...
 			One or more characters to use cyclically to show for
 			multiple consecutive spaces.  Overrides the "space"
 			setting, except for single spaces.  When omitted, the
 			"space" setting is used.  For example,
 			`:set listchars=multispace:---+` shows ten consecutive
 			spaces as: >
 				---+---+--
 <
 
 	  lead:c	Character to show for leading spaces.  When omitted,
 			leading spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
 			"multispace" settings for leading spaces.  You can
 			combine it with "tab:", for example: >
 				:set listchars+=tab:>-,lead:.
 <
 
 	  leadmultispace:c...
 			Like the |lcs-multispace| value, but for leading
 			spaces only.  Also overrides |lcs-lead| for leading
 			multiple spaces.
 			`:set listchars=leadmultispace:---+` shows ten
 			consecutive leading spaces as: >
 				---+---+--XXX
 <
 			Where "XXX" denotes the first non-blank characters in
 			the line.
 
 	  trail:c	Character to show for trailing spaces.  When omitted,
 			trailing spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
 			"multispace" settings for trailing spaces.
 
 	  extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when `'wrap'`  is
 			off and the line continues beyond the right of the
 			screen.
 
 	  precedes:c	Character to show in the first visible column of the
 			physical line, when there is text preceding the
 			character visible in the first column.
 
 	  conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
 			`'conceallevel'`  is set to 1.  A space when omitted.
 
 	  nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space character
 			(0xA0 (160 decimal) and U+202F).  Left blank when
 			omitted.
 
 	The characters `':'`  and `','`  should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can
 	be used.  All characters must be single width.
 
 	Each character can be specified as hex: >
 		set listchars=eol:\\x24
 		set listchars=eol:\\u21b5
 		set listchars=eol:\\U000021b5
 <	Note that a double backslash is used.  The number of hex characters
 	must be exactly 2 for \\x, 4 for \\u and 8 for \\U.
 
 	Examples: >
 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,trail:-
 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,eol:<,nbsp:%
 	    :set lcs=extends:>,precedes:<
 <	|hl-NonText| highlighting will be used for "eol", "extends" and

 `'makeencoding'`  `'menc'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	Encoding used for reading the output of external commands.  When empty,
 	encoding is not converted.
 	This is used for `:make`, `:lmake`, `:grep`, `:lgrep`, `:grepadd`,
 	`:lgrepadd`, `:cfile`, `:cgetfile`, `:caddfile`, `:lfile`, `:lgetfile`,
 	and `:laddfile`.
 
 	This would be mostly useful when you use MS-Windows.  If iconv is
 	enabled, setting `'makeencoding'`  to "char" has the same effect as
 	setting to the system locale encoding.  Example: >
 		:set makeencoding=char	" system locale is used

# vim.opt.maxfuncdepth

# vim.opt.maxmempattern

 `'maxmempattern'`  `'mmp'` 	number	(default 1000)
 			global
 	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for pattern matching.
 	The maximum value is about 2000000.  Use this to work without a limit.
 
 	When Vim runs into the limit it gives an error message and mostly
 	behaves like CTRL-C was typed.
 	Running into the limit often means that the pattern is very
 	inefficient or too complex.  This may already happen with the pattern
 	"\(.\)*" on a very long line.  ".*" works much better.
 	Might also happen on redraw, when syntax rules try to match a complex
 	text structure.
 	Vim may run out of memory before hitting the `'maxmempattern'`  limit, in
 	which case you get an "Out of memory" error instead.

# vim.opt.mkspellmem

 `'mkspellmem'`  `'msm'` 	string	(default "460000,2000,500")
 			global
 	Parameters for |:mkspell|.  This tunes when to start compressing the
 	word tree.  Compression can be slow when there are many words, but
 	it's needed to avoid running out of memory.  The amount of memory used
 	per word depends very much on how similar the words are, that's why
 	this tuning is complicated.
 
 	There are three numbers, separated by commas:
 		{start},{inc},{added}
 
 	For most languages the uncompressed word tree fits in memory.  {start}
 	gives the amount of memory in Kbyte that can be used before any
 	compression is done.  It should be a bit smaller than the amount of
 	memory that is available to Vim.
 
 	When going over the {start} limit the {inc} number specifies the
 	amount of memory in Kbyte that can be allocated before another
 	compression is done.  A low number means compression is done after
 	less words are added, which is slow.  A high number means more memory
 	will be allocated.
 
 	After doing compression, {added} times 1024 words can be added before
 	the {inc} limit is ignored and compression is done when any extra
 	amount of memory is needed.  A low number means there is a smaller
 	chance of hitting the {inc} limit, less memory is used but it's
 	slower.
 
 	The languages for which these numbers are important are Italian and
 	Hungarian.  The default works for when you have about 512 Mbyte.  If
 	you have 1 Gbyte you could use: >
 		:set mkspellmem=900000,3000,800
 <	If you have less than 512 Mbyte |:mkspell| may fail for some
 	languages, no matter what you set `'mkspellmem'`  to.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|.

# vim.opt.modified

 	1. A change was made to the text since it was last written.  Using the
 	   |undo| command to go back to the original text will reset the
 	   option.  But undoing changes that were made before writing the
 	   buffer will set the option again, since the text is different from
 	   when it was written.
 	2. `'fileformat'`  or `'fileencoding'`  is different from its original
 	   value.  The original value is set when the buffer is read or
 	   written.  A ":set nomodified" command also resets the original
 	   values to the current values and the `'modified'`  option will be
 	   reset.
 	   Similarly for `'eol'`  and `'bomb'` .
 	This option is not set when a change is made to the buffer as the
 	result of a BufNewFile, BufRead/BufReadPost, BufWritePost,
 	FileAppendPost or VimLeave autocommand event.  See |gzip-example| for
 	an explanation.
 	When `'buftype'`  is "nowrite" or "nofile" this option may be set, but
 	will be ignored.

 <
 	To temporarily disable mouse support, hold the shift key while using
 	the mouse.
 
 	Mouse support can be enabled for different modes:
 		n	Normal mode
 		v	Visual mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		c	Command-line mode
 		h	all previous modes when editing a help file
 		a	all previous modes
 		r	for |hit-enter| and |more-prompt| prompt
 
 	Left-click anywhere in a text buffer to place the cursor there.  This
 	works with operators too, e.g. type |d| then left-click to delete text
 	from the current cursor position to the position where you clicked.
 
 	Drag the |status-line| or vertical separator of a window to resize it.
 
 	If enabled for "v" (Visual mode) then double-click selects word-wise,
 	triple-click makes it line-wise, and quadruple-click makes it
 	rectangular block-wise.
 
 	For scrolling with a mouse wheel see |scroll-mouse-wheel|.
 
 	Note: When enabling the mouse in a terminal, copy/paste will use the
 	"* register if possible. See also `'clipboard'` .
 
 	Related options:
 	`'mousefocus'` 	window focus follows mouse pointer
 	`'mousemodel'` 	what mouse button does which action
 	`'mousehide'` 	hide mouse pointer while typing text
 	`'selectmode'` 	whether to start Select mode or Visual mode
 
 	The :behave command provides some "profiles" for mouse behavior.
 
 	:be[have] {model}	Set behavior for mouse and selection.  Valid
 				arguments are:
 				   mswin	MS-Windows behavior
 				   xterm	Xterm behavior

# vim.opt.mousemodel

 `'mousemodel'`  `'mousem'` 	string	(default "popup_setpos")
 			global
 	Sets the model to use for the mouse.  The name mostly specifies what
 	the right mouse button is used for:
 	   extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works
 			like in an xterm.
 	   popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
 			mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
 			with Microsoft Windows.
 	   popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the
 			position where the mouse was clicked, and thus the
 			selected operation will act upon the clicked object.
 			If clicking inside a selection, that selection will
 			be acted upon, i.e. no cursor move.  This implies of
 			course, that right clicking outside a selection will
 			end Visual mode.
 	Overview of what button does what for each model:
 	mouse		    extend		popup(_setpos) ~
 	left click	    place cursor	place cursor
 	left drag	    start selection	start selection
 	shift-left	    search word		extend selection
 	right click	    extend selection	popup menu (place cursor)
 	right drag	    extend selection	-
 	middle click	    paste		paste
 
 	In the "popup" model the right mouse button produces a pop-up menu.
 	Nvim creates a default |popup-menu| but you can redefine it.
 
 	Note that you can further refine the meaning of buttons with mappings.
 	See |mouse-overview|.  But mappings are NOT used for modeless selection.
 
 	Example: >
 	   :map <S-LeftMouse>     <RightMouse>
 	   :map <S-LeftDrag>      <RightDrag>
 	   :map <S-LeftRelease>   <RightRelease>
 	   :map <2-S-LeftMouse>   <2-RightMouse>
 	   :map <2-S-LeftDrag>    <2-RightDrag>
 	   :map <2-S-LeftRelease> <2-RightRelease>
 	   :map <3-S-LeftMouse>   <3-RightMouse>
 	   :map <3-S-LeftDrag>    <3-RightDrag>
 	   :map <3-S-LeftRelease> <3-RightRelease>
 	   :map <4-S-LeftMouse>   <4-RightMouse>
 	   :map <4-S-LeftDrag>    <4-RightDrag>
 	   :map <4-S-LeftRelease> <4-RightRelease>
 <
 	Mouse commands requiring the CTRL modifier can be simulated by typing
 	the "g" key before using the mouse:
 	    "g<LeftMouse>"  is "<C-LeftMouse>	(jump to tag under mouse click)
 	    "g<RightMouse>" is "<C-RightMouse>	("CTRL-T")

# vim.opt.mousescroll

 	Each part consists of a direction and a count as follows:
 		direction:count,direction:count
 	Direction is one of either "hor" or "ver". "hor" controls horizontal
 	scrolling and "ver" controls vertical scrolling. Count sets the amount
 	to scroll by for the given direction, it should be a non negative
 	integer. Each direction should be set at most once. If a direction
 	is omitted, a default value is used (6 for horizontal scrolling and 3
 	for vertical scrolling). You can disable mouse scrolling by using
 	a count of 0.

 		ve	Visual mode with `'selection'`  "exclusive" (same as `'v'` ,
 			if not specified)
 		o	Operator-pending mode
 		i	Insert mode
 		r	Replace mode
 
 			Others: ~
 		c	appending to the command-line
 		ci	inserting in the command-line
 		cr	replacing in the command-line
 		m	at the 'Hit ENTER' or `'More'`  prompts
 		ml	idem, but cursor in the last line
 		e	any mode, pointer below last window
 		s	any mode, pointer on a status line
 		sd	any mode, while dragging a status line
 		vs	any mode, pointer on a vertical separator line
 		vd	any mode, while dragging a vertical separator line
 		a	everywhere
 
 	The shape is one of the following:
 	avail	name		looks like ~
 	w x	arrow		Normal mouse pointer
 	w x	blank		no pointer at all (use with care!)
 	w x	beam		I-beam
 	w x	updown		up-down sizing arrows
 	w x	leftright	left-right sizing arrows
 	w x	busy		The system's usual busy pointer
 	w x	no		The system's usual "no input" pointer
 	  x	udsizing	indicates up-down resizing
 	  x	lrsizing	indicates left-right resizing
 	  x	crosshair	like a big thin +
 	  x	hand1		black hand
 	  x	hand2		white hand
 	  x	pencil		what you write with
 	  x	question	big ?
 	  x	rightup-arrow	arrow pointing right-up
 	w x	up-arrow	arrow pointing up
 	  x	<number>	any X11 pointer number (see X11/cursorfont.h)
 
 	The "avail" column contains a `'w'`  if the shape is available for Win32,
 	x for X11.
 	Any modes not specified or shapes not available use the normal mouse
 	pointer.
 
 	Example: >
 		:set mouseshape=s:udsizing,m:no
 <	will make the mouse turn to a sizing arrow over the status lines and
 	indicate no input when the hit-enter prompt is displayed (since
 	clicking the mouse has no effect in this state.)

# vim.opt.nrformats

 `'nrformats'`  `'nf'` 	string	(default "bin,hex")
 			local to buffer
 	This defines what bases Vim will consider for numbers when using the
 	CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands for adding to and subtracting from a number
 	respectively; see |CTRL-A| for more info on these commands.
 	alpha	If included, single alphabetical characters will be
 		incremented or decremented.  This is useful for a list with a
 		letter index a), b), etc.
 	octal	If included, numbers that start with a zero will be considered
 		to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in "010".
 	hex	If included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
 		considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
 		"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
 	bin	If included, numbers starting with "0b" or "0B" will be
 		considered to be binary.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
 		"0b1000" subtracts one, resulting in "0b0111".
 	unsigned    If included, numbers are recognized as unsigned. Thus a
 		leading dash or negative sign won't be considered as part of
 		the number.  Examples:
 		    Using CTRL-X on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2019"
 		    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2021").
 		    Using CTRL-A on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2021"
 		    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2019").
 		    Using CTRL-X on "0" or CTRL-A on "18446744073709551615"
 		    (2^64 - 1) has no effect, overflow is prevented.
 	Numbers which simply begin with a digit in the range 1-9 are always
 	considered decimal.  This also happens for numbers that are not
 	recognized as octal or hex.

# vim.opt.numberwidth

 `'numberwidth'`  `'nuw'` 	number	(default: 4)
 			local to window
 	Minimal number of columns to use for the line number.  Only relevant
 	when the `'number'`  or `'relativenumber'`  option is set or printing lines
 	with a line number. Since one space is always between the number and
 	the text, there is one less character for the number itself.
 	The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to
 	fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of
 	rows in the window, depending on whether `'number'`  or `'relativenumber'` 
 	is set. Thus with the Vim default of 4 there is room for a line number
 	up to 999. When the buffer has 1000 lines five columns will be used.
 	The minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 20.

# vim.opt.patchmode

 	source distribution.  Only the first time that a file is written a
 	copy of the original file will be kept.  The name of the copy is the
 	name of the original file with the string in the `'patchmode'`  option
 	appended.  This option should start with a dot.  Use a string like
 	".orig" or ".org".  `'backupdir'`  must not be empty for this to work
 	(Detail: The backup file is renamed to the patchmode file after the
 	new file has been successfully written, that's why it must be possible
 	to write a backup file).  If there was no file to be backed up, an
 	empty file is created.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a patchmode file is not made.
 	Using `'patchmode'`  for compressed files appends the extension at the
 	end (e.g., "file.gz.orig"), thus the resulting name isn't always
 	recognized as a compressed file.

# vim.opt.path

 `'path'`  `'pa'` 		string	(default on Unix: ".,/usr/include,,"
 				   other systems: ".,,")
 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
 	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
 	|gf|, [f, ]f, ^Wf, |:find|, |:sfind|, |:tabfind| and other commands,
 	provided that the file being searched for has a relative path (not
 	starting with "/", "./" or "../").  The directories in the `'path'` 
 	option may be relative or absolute.
 	- Use commas to separate directory names: >
 		:set path=.,/usr/local/include,/usr/include
 <	- Spaces can also be used to separate directory names (for backwards
 	  compatibility with version 3.0).  To have a space in a directory
 	  name, precede it with an extra backslash, and escape the space: >
 		:set path=.,/dir/with\\\ space
 <	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with an extra
 	  backslash: >
 		:set path=.,/dir/with\\,comma
 <	- To search relative to the directory of the current file, use: >
 		:set path=.
 <	- To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
 	  commas: >
 		:set path=,,
 <	- A directory name may end in a `':'`  or `'/'` .
 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 	- When using |netrw.vim| URLs can be used.  For example, adding
 	  "https://www.vim.org" will make ":find index.html" work.
 	- Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "" and
 	  ";".  See |file-searching| for info and syntax.
 	- Careful with `'\'`  characters, type two to get one in the option: >
 		:set path=.,c:\\include
 <	  Or just use `'/'`  instead: >
 		:set path=.,c:/include
 <	Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
 	the file!
 	The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
 	it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
 	You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
 	`'path'` , see |:checkpath|.
 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
 	uses another default.  To remove the current directory use: >
 		:set path-=
 <	To add the current directory use: >
 		:set path+=
 <	To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the
 	separator.  Here is an example to append $INCL, in which directory
 	names are separated with a semi-colon: >
 		:let &path = &path .. "," .. substitute($INCL, `';'` , `','` , `'g'` )
 <	Replace the `';'`  with a `':'`  or whatever separator is used.  Note that
 	this doesn't work when $INCL contains a comma or white space.

# vim.opt.preserveindent

 `'preserveindent'`  `'pi'` 	boolean	(default off)

 	series of tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |`'expandtab'` | is
 	enabled, in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option
 	means the indent will preserve as many existing characters as possible
 	for indenting, and only add additional tabs or spaces as required.
 	`'expandtab'`  does not apply to the preserved white space, a Tab remains
 	a Tab.
 	NOTE: When using ">>" multiple times the resulting indent is a mix of
 	tabs and spaces.  You might not like this.

 	in read-only mode ("vim -R") or when the executable is called "view".
 	When using ":w!" the `'readonly'`  option is reset for the current
 	buffer, unless the `'Z'`  flag is in `'cpoptions'` .
 	When using the ":view" command the `'readonly'`  option is set for the
 	newly edited buffer.

# vim.opt.redrawdebug

 `'redrawdebug'`  `'rdb'` 	string	(default `''` )
 			global
 	Flags to change the way redrawing works, for debugging purposes.
 	Most useful with `'writedelay'`  set to some reasonable value.
 	Supports the following flags:
 	    compositor	Indicate each redraw event handled by the compositor
 			by briefly flashing the redrawn regions in colors
 			indicating the redraw type. These are the highlight
 			groups used (and their default colors):
 		RedrawDebugNormal   gui=reverse   normal redraw passed through
 		RedrawDebugClear    guibg=Yellow  clear event passed through
 		RedrawDebugComposed guibg=Green   redraw event modified by the
 						  compositor (due to
 						  overlapping grids, etc)
 		RedrawDebugRecompose guibg=Red    redraw generated by the
 						  compositor itself, due to a
 						  grid being moved or deleted.
 	    line	introduce a delay after each line drawn on the screen.
 			When using the TUI or another single-grid UI, "compositor"
 			gives more information and should be preferred (every
 			line is processed as a separate event by the compositor)
 	    flush	introduce a delay after each "flush" event.
 	    nothrottle	Turn off throttling of the message grid. This is an
 			optimization that joins many small scrolls to one
 			larger scroll when drawing the message area (with
 			`'display'`  msgsep flag active).
 	    invalid	Enable stricter checking (abort) of inconsistencies
 			of the internal screen state. This is mostly
 			useful when running nvim inside a debugger (and
 			the test suite).
 	    nodelta	Send all internally redrawn cells to the UI, even if
 			they are unchanged from the already displayed state.

# vim.opt.redrawtime

 `'redrawtime'`  `'rdt'` 	number	(default 2000)
 			global
 	Time in milliseconds for redrawing the display.  Applies to
 	`'hlsearch'` , `'inccommand'` , |:match| highlighting and syntax
 	highlighting.
 	When redrawing takes more than this many milliseconds no further
 	matches will be highlighted.
 	For syntax highlighting the time applies per window.  When over the
 	limit syntax highlighting is disabled until |CTRL-L| is used.
 	This is used to avoid that Vim hangs when using a very complicated

 	The possible values are:
 		0	automatic selection
 		1	old engine
 		2	NFA engine
 	Note that when using the NFA engine and the pattern contains something
 	that is not supported the pattern will not match.  This is only useful
 	for debugging the regexp engine.
 	Using automatic selection enables Vim to switch the engine, if the
 	default engine becomes too costly.  E.g., when the NFA engine uses too
 	many states.  This should prevent Vim from hanging on a combination of
 	a complex pattern with long text.

# vim.opt.relativenumber

 `'relativenumber'`  `'rnu'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of
 	each line. Relative line numbers help you use the |count| you can
 	precede some vertical motion commands (e.g. j k + -) with, without
 	having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
 	other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
 	When the `'n'`  option is excluded from `'cpoptions'`  a wrapped
 	line will not use the column of line numbers.
 	The `'numberwidth'`  option can be used to set the room used for the line
 	number.
 	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, `'-'` 
 	characters are put before the number.
 	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
 	the number.
 
 	The number in front of the cursor line also depends on the value of
 	`'number'` , see |number_relativenumber| for all combinations of the two
 	options.

# vim.opt.ruler

 	text in the file is shown on the far right:
 		Top	first line is visible
 		Bot	last line is visible
 		All	first and last line are visible
 		45%	relative position in the file
 	If `'rulerformat'`  is set, it will determine the contents of the ruler.
 	Each window has its own ruler.  If a window has a status line, the
 	ruler is shown there.  If a window doesn't have a status line and
 	`'cmdheight'`  is zero, the ruler is not shown.  Otherwise it is shown in
 	the last line of the screen.  If the statusline is given by
 	`'statusline'`  (i.e. not empty), this option takes precedence over
 	`'ruler'`  and `'rulerformat'` .
 	If the number of characters displayed is different from the number of
 	bytes in the text (e.g., for a TAB or a multibyte character), both
 	the text column (byte number) and the screen column are shown,
 	separated with a dash.
 	For an empty line "0-1" is shown.
 	For an empty buffer the line number will also be zero: "0,0-1".
 	If you don't want to see the ruler all the time but want to know where

 	And any other file searched for with the |:runtime| command.
 
 	Defaults are setup to search these locations:
 	1. Your home directory, for personal preferences.
 	   Given by `stdpath("config")`.  |$XDG_CONFIG_HOME|
 	2. Directories which must contain configuration files according to
 	   |xdg| ($XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, defaults to /etc/xdg).  This also contains
 	   preferences from system administrator.
 	3. Data home directory, for plugins installed by user.
 	   Given by `stdpath("data")/site`.  |$XDG_DATA_HOME|
 	4. nvim/site subdirectories for each directory in $XDG_DATA_DIRS.
 	   This is for plugins which were installed by system administrator,
 	   but are not part of the Nvim distribution. XDG_DATA_DIRS defaults
 	   to /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/, so system administrators are
 	   expected to install site plugins to /usr/share/nvim/site.
 	5. Session state directory, for state data such as swap, backupdir,
 	   viewdir, undodir, etc.
 	   Given by `stdpath("state")`.  |$XDG_STATE_HOME|
 	6. $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Nvim.
 
 	7, 8, 9, 10. In after/ subdirectories of 1, 2, 3 and 4, with reverse
 	   ordering.  This is for preferences to overrule or add to the
 	   distributed defaults or system-wide settings (rarely needed).
 
 
 	"start" packages will also be searched (|runtime-search-path|) for
 	runtime files after these, though such packages are not explicitly
 	reported in &runtimepath. But "opt" packages are explicitly added to
 	&runtimepath by |:packadd|.
 
 	Note that, unlike `'path'` , no wildcards like "" are allowed.  Normal
 	wildcards are allowed, but can significantly slow down searching for
 	runtime files.  For speed, use as few items as possible and avoid
 	wildcards.
 	See |:runtime|.
 	Example: >
 		:set runtimepath=~/vimruntime,/mygroup/vim,$VIMRUNTIME
 <	This will use the directory "~/vimruntime" first (containing your
 	personal Nvim runtime files), then "/mygroup/vim", and finally
 	"$VIMRUNTIME" (the default runtime files).
 	You can put a directory before $VIMRUNTIME to find files which replace
 	distributed runtime files.  You can put a directory after $VIMRUNTIME
 	to find files which add to distributed runtime files.
 
 	With |--clean| the home directory entries are not included.

# vim.opt.scrollopt

 `'scrollopt'`  `'sbo'` 	string	(default "ver,jump")
 			global
 	This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
 	`'scrollbind'`  windows should behave.  `'sbo'`  stands for ScrollBind
 	Options.
 	The following words are available:
 	    ver		Bind vertical scrolling for `'scrollbind'`  windows
 	    hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for `'scrollbind'`  windows
 	    jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
 			scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
 			displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
 			around in a window, another `'scrollbind'`  window may
 			reach a position before the start or after the end of
 			the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
 			moving back the `'scrollbind'`  window will try to scroll
 			to the desired position when possible.
 			When now making that window the current one, two
 			things can be done with the relative offset:
 			1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
 			   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
 			   window.  When going back to the other window, the
 			   new relative offset will be used.
 			2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
 			   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
 			   going back to the other window, it still uses the
 			   same relative offset.
 	Also see |scroll-binding|.
 	When `'diff'`  mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
 	even when "ver" isn't there.

# vim.opt.selection

 `'selection'`  `'sel'` 	string	(default "inclusive")
 			global
 	This option defines the behavior of the selection.  It is only used
 	in Visual and Select mode.
 	Possible values:
 	   value	past line     inclusive ~
 	   old		   no		yes
 	   inclusive	   yes		yes
 	   exclusive	   yes		no
 	"past line" means that the cursor is allowed to be positioned one
 	character past the line.
 	"inclusive" means that the last character of the selection is included
 	in an operation.  For example, when "x" is used to delete the
 	selection.
 	When "old" is used and `'virtualedit'`  allows the cursor to move past
 	the end of line the line break still isn't included.
 	Note that when "exclusive" is used and selecting from the end
 	backwards, you cannot include the last character of a line, when
 	starting in Normal mode and `'virtualedit'`  empty.
 
 	The `'selection'`  option is set by the |:behave| command.

 			global
 	Changes the effect of the |:mksession| command.  It is a comma-

 	   word		save and restore ~
 	   blank	empty windows
 	   buffers	hidden and unloaded buffers, not just those in windows
 	   curdir	the current directory
 	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
 			fold options
 	   globals	global variables that start with an uppercase letter
 			and contain at least one lowercase letter.  Only
 			String and Number types are stored.
 	   help		the help window
 	   localoptions	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
 			global values for local options)
 	   options	all options and mappings (also global values for local
 			options)
 	   skiprtp	exclude `'runtimepath'`  and `'packpath'`  from the options
 	   resize	size of the Vim window: `'lines'`  and `'columns'` 
 	   sesdir	the directory in which the session file is located
 			will become the current directory (useful with
 			projects accessed over a network from different
 			systems)
 	   tabpages	all tab pages; without this only the current tab page
 			is restored, so that you can make a session for each
 			tab page separately
 	   terminal	include terminal windows where the command can be
 			restored
 	   winpos	position of the whole Vim window
 	   winsize	window sizes
 	   slash	|deprecated| Always enabled. Uses "/" in filenames.
 	   unix		|deprecated| Always enabled. Uses "\n" line endings.
 
 	Don't include both "curdir" and "sesdir". When neither is included
 	filenames are stored as absolute paths.

# vim.opt.shada

 `'shada'`  `'sd'` 		string	(default for
 				   Win32:  !,'100,<50,s10,h,rA:,rB:
 				   others: !,'100,<50,s10,h)
 			global
 	When non-empty, the shada file is read upon startup and written
 	when exiting Vim (see |shada-file|).  The string should be a comma-
 	separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
 	identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
 	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
 	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
 	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
 	the effect of their value.
 	CHAR	VALUE	~
 
 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
 
 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
 		the `'<'`  item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
 		start of a comment!
 
 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
 		(`'buftype'` ), unlisted (`'buflisted'` ), unnamed and buffers on
 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
 		buffers are stored.
 
 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
 		`'shada'`  is non-empty.
 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
 
 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
 		`'history'`  is used.
 
 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
 		saved.  When not included, the value of `'history'`  is used.
 
 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
 		saved.  `'"'`  is the old name for this item.
 		Also see the `'s'`  item below: limit specified in KiB.
 
 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
 		saved.  When not included, the value of `'history'`  is used.
 
 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and `'encoding'`  value is fixed
 		to UTF-8 as well.
 
 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
 
 	h	Disable the effect of `'hlsearch'`  when loading the shada
 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
 		has been used since the last search command.
 
 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
 		the `'n'` .  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
 		`'shadafile'`  option is set, that file name overrides the one
 		given here with `'shada'` .  Environment variables are
 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
 
 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
 		`','` ).  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
 
 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.
 
 	Example: >
 	    :set shada='50,<1000,s100,:0,n~/nvim/shada
 <
 	'50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
 			edited.
 	<1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
 			remembered.
 	s100		Items with contents occupying more then 100 KiB are
 			skipped.
 	:0		Command-line history will not be saved.
 	n~/nvim/shada	The name of the file to use is "~/nvim/shada".
 	no /		Since `'/'`  is not specified, the default will be used,
 			that is, save all of the search history, and also the
 			previous search and substitute patterns.
 	no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
 	no h		`'hlsearch'`  highlighting will be restored.
 
 	When setting `'shada'`  from an empty value you can use |:rshada| to
 	load the contents of the file, this is not done automatically.
 
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

# vim.opt.shell

 `'shell'`  `'sh'` 		string	(default $SHELL or "sh", Win32: "cmd.exe")
 			global
 	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
 	value also check these options: `'shellpipe'` , `'shellslash'` 
 	`'shellredir'` , `'shellquote'` , `'shellxquote'`  and `'shellcmdflag'` .
 	It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
 
 	If the name of the shell contains a space, you need to enclose it in
 	quotes.  Example with quotes: >
 		:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f
 <	Note the backslash before each quote (to avoid starting a comment) and
 	each space (to avoid ending the option value), so better use |:let-&|
 	like this: >
 		:let &shell='"C:\Program Files\unix\sh.exe" -f'
 <	Also note that the "-f" is not inside the quotes, because it is not
 	part of the command name.
 
 	Rules regarding quotes:
 	1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside
 	   quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument
 	   "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
 	   arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
 	   `'shellcmdflag'` ”).
 	2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
 	   `'"abc"'` , `'"a"bc'` , `'a"b"c'` , `'ab"c"'`  and `'"a"b"c"'`  are all equivalent
 	   to just "abc".
 	3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.
 	   Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding
 	   anything else means backslash and next character literally:
 	   `'"a\\b"'`  is the same as "a\b", `'"a\\"b"'`  runs shell named literally
 	   `'a"b'` , `'"a\b"'`  is the same as "a\b" again.
 	4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used
 	   to escape quote: `'a\"b"'`  is the same as "a\b".
 	Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of
 	unescaping, so to keep yourself sane use |:let-&| like shown above.
 
 	To use PowerShell: >
 		let &shell = executable(`'pwsh'` ) ? `'pwsh'`  : `'powershell'` 
 		let &shellcmdflag = '-NoLogo -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Command [Console]::InputEncoding=[Console]::OutputEncoding=[System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new();$PSDefaultParameterValues[`''` Out-File:Encoding`''` ]=`''` utf8`''` ;'
 		let &shellredir = '2>&1 | %%{ "$_" } | Out-File %s; exit $LastExitCode'
 		let &shellpipe  = '2>&1 | %%{ "$_" } | Tee-Object %s; exit $LastExitCode'
 		set shellquote= shellxquote=
 
 <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

# vim.opt.shellcmdflag

 	`bash.exe -c ls` or `cmd.exe /s /c "dir"`.  For MS-Windows, the
 	default is set according to the value of `'shell'` , to reduce the need
 	to set this option by the user.
 	On Unix it can have more than one flag.  Each white space separated
 	part is passed as an argument to the shell command.
 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

# vim.opt.shellpipe

 `'shellpipe'`  `'sp'` 	string	(default ">", "| tee", "|& tee" or "2>&1| tee")
 			global
 	String to be used to put the output of the ":make" command in the
 	error file.  See also |:make_makeprg|.  See |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes.
 	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
 	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
 	of this option).
 	For MS-Windows the default is "2>&1| tee".  The stdout and stderr are
 	saved in a file and echoed to the screen.
 	For Unix the default is "| tee".  The stdout of the compiler is saved
 	in a file and echoed to the screen.  If the `'shell'`  option is "csh" or
 	"tcsh" after initializations, the default becomes "|& tee".  If the
 	`'shell'`  option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh", "zsh-beta",
 	"bash", "fish", "ash" or "dash" the default becomes "2>&1| tee".  This
 	means that stderr is also included.  Before using the `'shell'`  option a
 	path is removed, thus "/bin/sh" uses "sh".
 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
 	and the other initializations, so that when the `'shell'`  option is set
 	there, the `'shellpipe'`  option changes automatically, unless it was
 	explicitly set before.
 	When `'shellpipe'`  is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
 	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a `'makeprg'` 
 	that writes to `'makeef'`  by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
 	want to include the `'makeef'` , set `'shellpipe'`  to a single space.
 	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
 	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
 	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

# vim.opt.shellquote

 	third-party shells on Windows systems, such as the MKS Korn Shell
 	or bash, where it should be "\"".  The default is adjusted according

# vim.opt.shellredir

 			global
 	String to be used to put the output of a filter command in a temporary
 	file.  See also |:!|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces
 	and backslashes.
 	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
 	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
 	of this option).
 	The default is ">".  For Unix, if the `'shell'`  option is "csh" or
 	"tcsh" during initializations, the default becomes ">&".  If the
 	`'shell'`  option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh", "zsh-beta",
 	"bash" or "fish", the default becomes ">%s 2>&1".  This means that
 	stderr is also included.  For Win32, the Unix checks are done and
 	additionally "cmd" is checked for, which makes the default ">%s 2>&1".
 	Also, the same names with ".exe" appended are checked for.
 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
 	and the other initializations, so that when the `'shell'`  option is set
 	there, the `'shellredir'`  option changes automatically unless it was
 	explicitly set before.

 	slashes can still be typed, but they are changed to forward slashes by
 	Vim.
 	Note that setting or resetting this option has no effect for some
 	existing file names, thus this option needs to be set before opening
 	any file for best results.  This might change in the future.

 	When using a pipe is not possible temp files are used anyway.
 	The advantage of using a pipe is that nobody can read the temp file

 	The advantage of using a temp file is that the file type and encoding
 	can be detected.

 	This option helps to avoid all the |hit-enter| prompts caused by file

 	It is a list of flags:
 	 flag	meaning when present	~
 	  f	use "(3 of 5)" instead of "(file 3 of 5)"
 	  i	use "[noeol]" instead of "[Incomplete last line]"
 	  l	use "999L, 888B" instead of "999 lines, 888 bytes"
 	  m	use "[+]" instead of "[Modified]"
 	  n	use "[New]" instead of "[New File]"
 	  r	use "[RO]" instead of "[readonly]"
 	  w	use "[w]" instead of "written" for file write message
 		and "[a]" instead of "appended" for ':w >> file' command
 	  x	use "[dos]" instead of "[dos format]", "[unix]"
 		instead of "[unix format]" and "[mac]" instead of "[mac
 		format]"
 	  a	all of the above abbreviations
 
 	  o	overwrite message for writing a file with subsequent
 		message for reading a file (useful for ":wn" or when
 		`'autowrite'`  on)
 	  O	message for reading a file overwrites any previous
 		message;  also for quickfix message (e.g., ":cn")
 	  s	don't give "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP" or
 		"search hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages; when using
 		the search count do not show "W" after the count message (see
 		S below)
 	  t	truncate file message at the start if it is too long
 		to fit on the command-line, "<" will appear in the left most
 		column; ignored in Ex mode
 	  T	truncate other messages in the middle if they are too
 		long to fit on the command line; "..." will appear in the
 		middle; ignored in Ex mode
 	  W	don't give "written" or "[w]" when writing a file
 	  A	don't give the "ATTENTION" message when an existing
 		swap file is found
 	  I	don't give the intro message when starting Vim,
 		see |:intro|
 	  c	don't give |ins-completion-menu| messages; for
 		example, "-- XXX completion (YYY)", "match 1 of 2", "The only
 		match", "Pattern not found", "Back at original", etc.
 	  C	don't give messages while scanning for ins-completion
 		items, for instance "scanning tags"
 	  q	use "recording" instead of "recording @a"
 	  F	don't give the file info when editing a file, like
 		`:silent` was used for the command
 	  S	do not show search count message when searching, e.g.
 		"[1/5]"
 
 	This gives you the opportunity to avoid that a change between buffers
 	requires you to hit <Enter>, but still gives as useful a message as
 	possible for the space available.  To get the whole message that you
 	would have got with `'shm'`  empty, use ":file!"
 	Useful values:
 	    shm=	No abbreviation of message.
 	    shm=a	Abbreviation, but no loss of information.
 	    shm=at	Abbreviation, and truncate message when necessary.

 	show the match can be set with `'matchtime'` .
 	A Beep is given if there is no match (no matter if the match can be
 	seen or not).
 	When the `'m'`  flag is not included in `'cpoptions'` , typing a character
 	will immediately move the cursor back to where it belongs.
 	See the "sm" field in `'guicursor'`  for setting the cursor shape and
 	blinking when showing the match.
 	The `'matchpairs'`  option can be used to specify the characters to show
 	matches for.  `'rightleft'`  and `'revins'`  are used to look for opposite
 	matches.
 	Also see the matchparen plugin for highlighting the match when moving

# vim.opt.sidescrolloff

 	right of the cursor if `'nowrap'`  is set.  Setting this option to a
 	value greater than 0 while having |`'sidescroll'` | also at a non-zero
 	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
 	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
 	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
 	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too
 	close to the beginning of the line.
 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
 	these two: >
 		setlocal sidescrolloff<
 		setlocal sidescrolloff=-1
 <
 	Example: Try this together with `'sidescroll'`  and `'listchars'`  as
 		 in the following example to never allow the cursor to move

# vim.opt.signcolumn

 `'signcolumn'`  `'scl'` 	string	(default "auto")
 			local to window

 	   "auto"	only when there is a sign to display
 	   "auto:[1-9]" resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
 	                given number (maximum 9), e.g. "auto:4"
 	   "auto:[1-8]-[2-9]"
 	                resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
 			given maximum number (maximum 9) while keeping
 			at least the given minimum (maximum 8) fixed
 			space. The minimum number should always be less
 			than the maximum number, e.g. "auto:2-5"
 	   "no"		never
 	   "yes"	always
 	   "yes:[1-9]"  always, with fixed space for signs up to the given
 	                number (maximum 9), e.g. "yes:3"
 	   "number"	display signs in the `'number'`  column. If the number
 			column is not present, then behaves like "auto".
 
 	Note regarding "orphaned signs": with signcolumn numbers higher than
 	1, deleting lines will also remove the associated signs automatically,
 	in contrast to the default Vim behavior of keeping and grouping them.
 	This is done in order for the signcolumn appearance not appear weird

# vim.opt.smartindent

 `'smartindent'`  `'si'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to buffer
 	Do smart autoindenting when starting a new line.  Works for C-like
 	programs, but can also be used for other languages.  `'cindent'`  does
 	something like this, works better in most cases, but is more strict,
 	see |C-indenting|.  When `'cindent'`  is on or `'indentexpr'`  is set,
 	setting `'si'`  has no effect.  `'indentexpr'`  is a more advanced
 	alternative.
 	Normally `'autoindent'`  should also be on when using `'smartindent'` .
 	An indent is automatically inserted:
 	- After a line ending in "{".
 	- After a line starting with a keyword from `'cinwords'` .
 	- Before a line starting with "}" (only with the "O" command).
 	When typing `'}'`  as the first character in a new line, that line is
 	given the same indent as the matching "{".
 	When typing `'#'`  as the first character in a new line, the indent for
 	that line is removed, the `'#'`  is put in the first column.  The indent
 	is restored for the next line.  If you don't want this, use this
 	mapping: ":inoremap # X^H#", where ^H is entered with CTRL-V CTRL-H.
 	When using the ">>" command, lines starting with `'#'`  are not shifted

# vim.opt.smarttab

 	<BS> will delete a `'shiftwidth'`  worth of space at the start of the
 	line.
 	When off, a <Tab> always inserts blanks according to `'tabstop'`  or
 	`'softtabstop'` .  `'shiftwidth'`  is only used for shifting text left or
 	right |shift-left-right|.
 	What gets inserted (a <Tab> or spaces) depends on the `'expandtab'`

 	<Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mix of spaces and <Tab>s is
 	used.  This is useful to keep the `'ts'`  setting at its standard value
 	of 8, while being able to edit like it is set to `'sts'` .  However,
 	commands like "x" still work on the actual characters.
 	When `'sts'`  is zero, this feature is off.
 	When `'sts'`  is negative, the value of `'shiftwidth'`  is used.
 	See also |ins-expandtab|.  When `'expandtab'`  is not set, the number of
 	spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
 	The `'L'`  flag in `'cpoptions'`  changes how tabs are used when `'list'`  is

 	path, otherwise the file is placed in the current directory.
 
 	It may also be a comma-separated list of names.  A count before the
 	|zg| and |zw| commands can be used to access each.  This allows using
 	a personal word list file and a project word list file.
 	When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
 	you: Using the first directory in `'runtimepath'`  that is writable.  If
 	there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
 	name the first language name that appears in `'spelllang'`  is used,
 	ignoring the region.
 	The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
 	have to appear in `'spelllang'` .
 	Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
 	name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
 	`'spellfile'`  is set to it, for entries in `'spelllang'`  only files

 <	This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
 	that are not recognized will be highlighted.
 	The word list name must consist of alphanumeric characters, a dash or
 	an underscore.  It should not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
 	recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
 	specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
 	A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
 	the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
 	region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
 	English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
 	Britain. (Note: currently en_au and en_nz dictionaries are older than
 	en_ca, en_gb and en_us).
 	If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
 	spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
 	words.
 	Note that the "medical" dictionary does not exist, it is just an
 	example of a longer name.
 
 	As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
 	first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
 	(_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
 	This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
 	encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
 	How the related spell files are found is explained here: |spell-load|.
 
 	If the |spellfile.vim| plugin is active and you use a language name
 	for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in `'runtimepath'`  the plugin
 	will ask you if you want to download the file.
 
 	After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
 	"spell/LANG.vim" in `'runtimepath'` .  "LANG" is the value of `'spelllang'` 
 	up to the first character that is not an ASCII letter or number and
 	not a dash.  Also see |set-spc-auto|.

# vim.opt.spellsuggest

 `'spellsuggest'`  `'sps'` 	string	(default "best")
 			global
 	Methods used for spelling suggestions.  Both for the |z=| command and
 	the |spellsuggest()| function.  This is a comma-separated list of
 	items:
 
 	best		Internal method that works best for English.  Finds
 			changes like "fast" and uses a bit of sound-a-like
 			scoring to improve the ordering.
 
 	double		Internal method that uses two methods and mixes the
 			results.  The first method is "fast", the other method
 			computes how much the suggestion sounds like the bad
 			word.  That only works when the language specifies
 			sound folding.  Can be slow and doesn't always give
 			better results.
 
 	fast		Internal method that only checks for simple changes:
 			character inserts/deletes/swaps.  Works well for
 			simple typing mistakes.
 
 	{number}	The maximum number of suggestions listed for |z=|.
 			Not used for |spellsuggest()|.  The number of
 			suggestions is never more than the value of `'lines'` 
 			minus two.
 
 	timeout:{millisec}   Limit the time searching for suggestions to
 			{millisec} milli seconds.  Applies to the following
 			methods.  When omitted the limit is 5000. When
 			negative there is no limit.
 
 	file:{filename} Read file {filename}, which must have two columns,
 			separated by a slash.  The first column contains the
 			bad word, the second column the suggested good word.
 			Example:
 				theribal/terrible ~
 			Use this for common mistakes that do not appear at the
 			top of the suggestion list with the internal methods.
 			Lines without a slash are ignored, use this for
 			comments.
 			The word in the second column must be correct,
 			otherwise it will not be used.  Add the word to an
 			".add" file if it is currently flagged as a spelling
 			mistake.
 			The file is used for all languages.
 
 	expr:{expr}	Evaluate expression {expr}.  Use a function to avoid
 			trouble with spaces.  |v:val| holds the badly spelled
 			word.  The expression must evaluate to a List of
 			Lists, each with a suggestion and a score.
 			Example:
 				[[`'the'` , 33], [`'that'` , 44]] ~
 			Set `'verbose'`  and use |z=| to see the scores that the
 			internal methods use.  A lower score is better.
 			This may invoke |spellsuggest()| if you temporarily
 			set `'spellsuggest'`  to exclude the "expr:" part.
 			Errors are silently ignored, unless you set the
 			`'verbose'`  option to a non-zero value.
 
 	Only one of "best", "double" or "fast" may be used.  The others may
 	appear several times in any order.  Example: >
 		:set sps=file:~/.config/nvim/sugg,best,expr:MySuggest()
 <
 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
 	security reasons.

# vim.opt.statuscolumn

 `'statuscolumn'`  `'stc'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			local to window
 	EXPERIMENTAL
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the area to the
 	side of a window, normally containing the fold, sign and number columns.
 	The format of this option is like that of `'statusline'` .
 
 	Some of the items from the `'statusline'`  format are different for
 	`'statuscolumn'` :
 
 	%l	line number of currently drawn line
 	%r	relative line number of currently drawn line
 	%s	sign column for currently drawn line
 	%C	fold column for currently drawn line
 
 	NOTE: To draw the sign and fold columns, their items must be included in
 	`'statuscolumn'` . Even when they are not included, the status column width
 	will adapt to the `'signcolumn'`  and `'foldcolumn'`  width.
 
 	The |v:lnum|    variable holds the line number to be drawn.
 	The |v:relnum|  variable holds the relative line number to be drawn.
 	The |v:virtnum| variable is negative when drawing virtual lines, zero
 		      when drawing the actual buffer line, and positive when
 		      drawing the wrapped part of a buffer line.
 
 	NOTE: The %@ click execute function item is supported as well but the
 	specified function will be the same for each row in the same column.
 	It cannot be switched out through a dynamic `'statuscolumn'`  format, the
 	handler should be written with this in mind.
 
 	Examples: >vim
 		" Relative number with bar separator and click handlers:
 		:set statuscolumn=%@SignCb@%s%=%T%@NumCb@%r│%T
 
 		" Right aligned relative cursor line number:
 		:let &stc='%=%{v:relnum?v:relnum:v:lnum} '
 
 		" Line numbers in hexadecimal for non wrapped part of lines:
 		:let &stc='%=%{v:virtnum>0?"":printf("%x",v:lnum)} '
 
 		" Human readable line numbers with thousands separator:
 		:let &stc=`'%{substitute(v:lnum,"\\d\\zs\\ze\\'` 
 			   . `'%(\\d\\d\\d\\)\\+$",",","g")}'` 
 
 		" Both relative and absolute line numbers with different
 		" highlighting for odd and even relative numbers:
 		:let &stc=`'%#NonText#%{&nu?v:lnum:""}'`  .
 		 '%=%{&rnu&&(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}' .
 		 '%#LineNr#%{&rnu&&!(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}'
 
 <	WARNING: this expression is evaluated for each screen line so defining
 	an expensive expression can negatively affect render performance.

# vim.opt.statusline

 `'statusline'`  `'stl'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the status line.
 	Also see |status-line|.
 
 	The option consists of printf style `'%'`  items interspersed with
 	normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
 	  %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
 	All fields except the {item} are optional.  A single percent sign can
 	be given as "%%".
 
 	When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
 	evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example: >
 		:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
 <	The  variable will be set to the |window-ID| of the
 	window that the status line belongs to.
 	The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
 	Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
 	current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
 	context of the window that the statusline belongs to.
 
 	When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
 	empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.
 	When the result contains unprintable characters the result is
 	unpredictable.
 
 	Note that the only effect of `'ruler'`  when this option is set (and
 	`'laststatus'`  is 2 or 3) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.
 
 	field	    meaning ~
 	-	    Left justify the item.  The default is right justified
 		    when minwid is larger than the length of the item.
 	0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by "-".
 	minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by "-" & "0".
 		    Value must be 50 or less.
 	maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a "<"
 		    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be
 		    shifted down to maxwid-2 digits followed by ">"number
 		    where number is the amount of missing digits, much like
 		    an exponential notation.
 	item	    A one letter code as described below.
 
 	Following is a description of the possible statusline items.  The
 	second character in "item" is the type:
 		N for number
 		S for string
 		F for flags as described below
 		- not applicable
 
 	item  meaning ~
 	f S   Path to the file in the buffer, as typed or relative to current
 	      directory.
 	F S   Full path to the file in the buffer.
 	t S   File name (tail) of file in the buffer.
 	m F   Modified flag, text is "[+]"; "[-]" if `'modifiable'`  is off.
 	M F   Modified flag, text is ",+" or ",-".
 	r F   Readonly flag, text is "[RO]".
 	R F   Readonly flag, text is ",RO".
 	h F   Help buffer flag, text is "[help]".
 	H F   Help buffer flag, text is ",HLP".
 	w F   Preview window flag, text is "[Preview]".
 	W F   Preview window flag, text is ",PRV".
 	y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., "[vim]".  See `'filetype'` .
 	Y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., ",VIM".  See `'filetype'` .
 	q S   "[Quickfix List]", "[Location List]" or empty.
 	k S   Value of "b:keymap_name" or `'keymap'`  when |:lmap| mappings are
 	      being used: "<keymap>"
 	n N   Buffer number.
 	b N   Value of character under cursor.
 	B N   As above, in hexadecimal.
 	o N   Byte number in file of byte under cursor, first byte is 1.
 	      Mnemonic: Offset from start of file (with one added)
 	O N   As above, in hexadecimal.
 	l N   Line number.
 	L N   Number of lines in buffer.
 	c N   Column number (byte index).
 	v N   Virtual column number (screen column).
 	V N   Virtual column number as -{num}.  Not displayed if equal to `'c'` .
 	p N   Percentage through file in lines as in |CTRL-G|.
 	P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the
 	      percentage described for `'ruler'` .  Always 3 in length, unless
 	      translated.
 	S S   `'showcmd'`  content, see `'showcmdloc'` .
 	a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
 	      Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
 	{ NF  Evaluate expression between "%{" and "}" and substitute result.
 	      Note that there is no "%" before the closing "}".  The
 	      expression cannot contain a "}" character, call a function to
 	      work around that.  See |stl-%{| below.
 	`{%` -  This is almost same as "{" except the result of the expression is
 	      re-evaluated as a statusline format string.  Thus if the
 	      return value of expr contains "%" items they will get expanded.
 	      The expression can contain the "}" character, the end of
 	      expression is denoted by "%}".
 	      For example: >
 		func! Stl_filename() abort
 		    return "%t"
 		endfunc
 <	        `stl=%{Stl_filename()}`   results in `"%t"`
 	        `stl=%{%Stl_filename()%}` results in `"Name of current file"`
 	%} -  End of "{%" expression
 	( -   Start of item group.  Can be used for setting the width and
 	      alignment of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
 	) -   End of item group.  No width fields allowed.
 	T N   For `'tabline'` : start of tab page N label.  Use %T or %X to end
 	      the label.  Clicking this label with left mouse button switches
 	      to the specified tab page.
 	X N   For `'tabline'` : start of close tab N label.  Use %X or %T to end
 	      the label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current
 	      tab" label.    Clicking this label with left mouse button closes
 	      specified tab page.
 	@ N   Start of execute function label. Use %X or %T to
 	      end the label, e.g.: %10@SwitchBuffer@foo.c%X.  Clicking this
 	      label runs specified function: in the example when clicking once
 	      using left mouse button on "foo.c" "SwitchBuffer(10, 1, `'l'` ,
 	      '    ')" expression will be run.  Function receives the
 	      following arguments in order:
 	      1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
 	      2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
 	      3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle
 	         button respectively; one should not rely on third argument
 	         being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value
 	         that contains only ASCII lower case letters may be expected
 	         for other mouse buttons
 	      4. modifiers pressed: string which contains "s" if shift
 	         modifier was pressed, "c" for control, "a" for alt and "m"
 	         for meta; currently if modifier is not pressed string
 	         contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence
 	         of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use |stridx()| to
 	         test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed
 	         to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per
 	         modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence
 	         is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was
 	         added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on
 	         this label.
 	      Use |getmousepos()|.winid in the specified function to get the
 	      corresponding window id of the clicked item.
 	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
 	      No width fields allowed.
 	= -   Separation point between alignment sections.  Each section will
 	      be separated by an equal number of spaces.  With one %= what
 	      comes after it will be right-aligned.  With two %= there is a
 	      middle part, with white space left and right of it.
 	      No width fields allowed.
 	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
 	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
 	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
 	      windows.
 	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
 	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
 	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine will be applied to
 	      StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
 	      The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|
 
 	When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
 	that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
 	when flags are used like in the examples below.
 
 	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
 	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
 	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
 	completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
 		:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
 <	Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
 	line is displayed.
 
 	While evaluating %{} the current buffer and current window will be set
 	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
 	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
 	The variable "g:actual_curbuf" is set to the `bufnr()` number of the
 	real current buffer and "g:actual_curwin" to the |window-ID| of the
 	real current window.  These values are strings.
 
 	The `'statusline'`  option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
 	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'statusline'`  |textlock|.
 
 	If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
 	a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
 	using `:redrawstatus`.
 
 	A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
 	Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
 	described above.
 
 	Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
 	If you are stuck, hold down `':'`  or `'Q'`  to get a prompt, then quit and
 	edit your vimrc or whatever with "vim --clean" to get it right.
 
 	Examples:
 	Emulate standard status line with `'ruler'`  set >
 	  :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
 <	Similar, but add ASCII value of char under the cursor (like "ga") >
 	  :set statusline=%<%f%h%m%r%=%b\ 0x%B\ \ %l,%c%V\ %P
 <	Display byte count and byte value, modified flag in red. >
 	  :set statusline=%<%f%=\ [%1%n%R%H]\ %-19(%3l,%02c%03V%)%O`'%02b'` 
 	  :hi User1 term=inverse,bold cterm=inverse,bold ctermfg=red
 <	Display a ,GZ flag if a compressed file is loaded >
 	  :set statusline=...%r%{VarExists(`'b:gzflag'` ,'\ [GZ]')}%h...
 <	In the |:autocmd|'s: >
 	  :let b:gzflag = 1
 <	And: >
 	  :unlet b:gzflag
 <	And define this function: >
 	  :function VarExists(var, val)
 	  :    if exists(a:var) | return a:val | else | return `''`  | endif

# vim.opt.suffixes

 `'suffixes'`  `'su'` 		string	(default ".bak,~,.o,.h,.info,.swp,.obj")
 			global
 	Files with these suffixes get a lower priority when multiple files
 	match a wildcard.  See |suffixes|.  Commas can be used to separate the
 	suffixes.  Spaces after the comma are ignored.  A dot is also seen as
 	the start of a suffix.  To avoid a dot or comma being recognized as a
 	separator, precede it with a backslash (see |option-backslash| about
 	including spaces and backslashes).
 	See `'wildignore'`  for completely ignoring files.

 	confidential information that even root must not be able to access.
 	Careful: All text will be in memory:
 		- Don't use this for big files.
 		- Recovery will be impossible!
 	A swapfile will only be present when |`'updatecount'` | is non-zero and
 	`'swapfile'`  is set.
 	When `'swapfile'`  is reset, the swap file for the current buffer is
 	immediately deleted.  When `'swapfile'`  is set, and `'updatecount'`  is
 	non-zero, a swap file is immediately created.
 	Also see |swap-file|.
 	If you want to open a new buffer without creating a swap file for it,
 	use the |:noswapfile| modifier.
 	See `'directory'`  for where the swap file is created.
 
 	This option is used together with `'bufhidden'`  and `'buftype'`  to

# vim.opt.switchbuf

 	Possible values (comma-separated list):
 	   useopen	If included, jump to the first open window that
 			contains the specified buffer (if there is one).
 			Otherwise: Do not examine other windows.
 			This setting is checked with |quickfix| commands, when
 			jumping to errors (":cc", ":cn", "cp", etc.).  It is
 			also used in all buffer related split commands, for
 			example ":sbuffer", ":sbnext", or ":sbrewind".
 	   usetab	Like "useopen", but also consider windows in other tab
 			pages.
 	   split	If included, split the current window before loading
 			a buffer for a |quickfix| command that display errors.
 			Otherwise: do not split, use current window (when used
 			in the quickfix window: the previously used window or
 			split if there is no other window).
 	   vsplit	Just like "split" but split vertically.
 	   newtab	Like "split", but open a new tab page.  Overrules
 			"split" when both are present.

 	When this option is set, the syntax with this name is loaded, unless
 	syntax highlighting has been switched off with ":syntax off".
 	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current syntax (the
 	b:current_syntax variable does).
 	This option is most useful in a modeline, for a file which syntax is
 	not automatically recognized.  Example, in an IDL file: >
 		/* vim: set syntax=idl : */
 <	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
 	names.  Example: >
 		/* vim: set syntax=c.doxygen : */
 <	This will use the "c" syntax first, then the "doxygen" syntax.
 	Note that the second one must be prepared to be loaded as an addition,
 	otherwise it will be skipped.  More than one dot may appear.
 	To switch off syntax highlighting for the current file, use: >
 		:set syntax=OFF
 <	To switch syntax highlighting on according to the current value of the
 	`'filetype'`  option: >
 		:set syntax=ON
 <	What actually happens when setting the `'syntax'`  option is that the
 	Syntax autocommand event is triggered with the value as argument.
 	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the `'s'`  or
 	`'S'`  flag in `'cpoptions'` .
 	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

# vim.opt.tabline

 `'tabline'`  `'tal'` 		string	(default empty)
 			global
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the tab pages
 	line at the top of the Vim window.  When empty Vim will use a default
 	tab pages line.  See |setting-tabline| for more info.
 
 	The tab pages line only appears as specified with the `'showtabline'` 
 	option and only when there is no GUI tab line.  When `'e'`  is in
 	`'guioptions'`  and the GUI supports a tab line `'guitablabel'`  is used
 	instead.  Note that the two tab pages lines are very different.
 
 	The value is evaluated like with `'statusline'` .  You can use
 	|tabpagenr()|, |tabpagewinnr()| and |tabpagebuflist()| to figure out
 	the text to be displayed.  Use "%1T" for the first label, "%2T" for
 	the second one, etc.  Use "%X" items for closing labels.
 
 	When changing something that is used in `'tabline'`  that does not
 	trigger it to be updated, use |:redrawtabline|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	Keep in mind that only one of the tab pages is the current one, others
 	are invisible and you can't jump to their windows.

# vim.opt.tabstop

 `'tabstop'`  `'ts'` 		number	(default 8)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
 	the |:retab| command, and the `'softtabstop'`  option.
 
 	Note: Setting `'tabstop'`  to any other value than 8 can make your file
 	appear wrong in many places.
 	The value must be more than 0 and less than 10000.
 
 	There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
 	1. Always keep `'tabstop'`  at 8, set `'softtabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to 4
 	   (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use `'noexpandtab'` .  Then Vim
 	   will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
 	   behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
 	2. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use
 	   `'expandtab'` .  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
 	   formatting will never be messed up when `'tabstop'`  is changed.
 	3. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use a
 	   |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
 	   works when using Vim to edit the file.
 	4. Always set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to the same value, and
 	   `'noexpandtab'` .  This should then work (for initial indents only)
 	   for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
 	   tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
 	   though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when `'tabstop'`  is
 	   changed.
 
 	The value of `'tabstop'`  will be ignored if |`'vartabstop'` | is set to
 	anything other than an empty string.

# vim.opt.tagbsearch

 `'tagbsearch'`  `'tbs'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When searching for a tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command), Vim can either
 	use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
 	searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
 	will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
 	Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
 	they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
 	`'tagbsearch'`  option need to be switched off.
 
 	When `'tagbsearch'`  is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
 	files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
 	certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
 	`'tagbsearch'`  is off, only a linear search is done.
 
 	Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
 	at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted: >
    !_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/some comment/
 <	[The whitespace before and after the `'0'`  must be a single <Tab>]
 
 	When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
 	files listed in `'tags'` , and case is ignored or a pattern is used
 	instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
 	Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
 	be found in the retry.
 
 	If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
 	linear search can be avoided when case is ignored.  Use a value of `'2'` 
 	in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be case-fold
 	sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in the command:
 	"sort -f -o tags tags".  For Universal ctags and Exuberant ctags
 	version 5.x or higher (at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be
 	used for this as well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for
 	this to work.
 
 	By default, tag searches are case-sensitive.  Case is ignored when
 	`'ignorecase'`  is set and `'tagcase'`  is "followic", or when `'tagcase'`  is
 	"ignore".
 	Also when `'tagcase'`  is "followscs" and `'smartcase'`  is set, or
 	`'tagcase'`  is "smart", and the pattern contains only lowercase
 	characters.
 
 	When `'tagbsearch'`  is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
 	exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
 	files may only be found with `'tagbsearch'`  off.
 	When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
 	ASCII byte value), `'tagbsearch'`  should be off, or the line given above
 	must be included in the tags file.
 	This option doesn't affect commands that find all matching tags (e.g.,
 	command-line completion and ":help").

 	When this option contains printf-style `'%'`  items, they will be

 	    :set title titlestring=%<%F%=%l/%L-%P titlelen=70
 <	The value of `'titlelen'`  is used to align items in the middle or right

# vim.opt.ttimeout

 `'ttimeout'` 		boolean (default on)
 			global
 	This option and `'ttimeoutlen'`  determine the behavior when part of a
 	key code sequence has been received by the |TUI|.
 
 	For example if <Esc> (the \x1b byte) is received and `'ttimeout'`  is
 	set, Nvim waits `'ttimeoutlen'`  milliseconds for the terminal to
 	complete a key code sequence. If no input arrives before the timeout,
 	a single <Esc> is assumed. Many TUI cursor key codes start with <Esc>.
 
 	On very slow systems this may fail, causing cursor keys not to work
 	sometimes.  If you discover this problem you can ":set ttimeoutlen=9999".
 	Nvim will wait for the next character to arrive after an <Esc>.

# vim.opt.virtualedit

 `'virtualedit'`  `'ve'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	A comma-separated list of these words:
 	    block	Allow virtual editing in Visual block mode.
 	    insert	Allow virtual editing in Insert mode.
 	    all		Allow virtual editing in all modes.
 	    onemore	Allow the cursor to move just past the end of the line
 	    none	When used as the local value, do not allow virtual
 			editing even when the global value is set.  When used
 			as the global value, "none" is the same as "".
 	    NONE	Alternative spelling of "none".
 
 	Virtual editing means that the cursor can be positioned where there is
 	no actual character.  This can be halfway into a tab or beyond the end
 	of the line.  Useful for selecting a rectangle in Visual mode and
 	editing a table.
 	"onemore" is not the same, it will only allow moving the cursor just
 	after the last character of the line.  This makes some commands more
 	consistent.  Previously the cursor was always past the end of the line
 	if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi compatible.  It may also
 	break some plugins or Vim scripts.  For example because |l| can move
 	the cursor after the last character.  Use with care!
 	Using the `$` command will move to the last character in the line, not
 	past it.  This may actually move the cursor to the left!
 	The `g$` command will move to the end of the screen line.
 	It doesn't make sense to combine "all" with "onemore", but you will
 	not get a warning for it.
 	When combined with other words, "none" is ignored.

# vim.opt.whichwrap

 `'whichwrap'`  `'ww'` 	string	(default: "b,s")
 			global
 	Allow specified keys that move the cursor left/right to move to the
 	previous/next line when the cursor is on the first/last character in
 	the line.  Concatenate characters to allow this for these keys:
 		char   key	  mode	~
 		 b    <BS>	 Normal and Visual
 		 s    <Space>	 Normal and Visual
 		 h    "h"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
 		 l    "l"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
 		 <    <Left>	 Normal and Visual
 		 >    <Right>	 Normal and Visual
 		 ~    "~"	 Normal
 		 [    <Left>	 Insert and Replace
 		 ]    <Right>	 Insert and Replace
 	For example: >
 		:set ww=<,>,[,]
 <	allows wrap only when cursor keys are used.
 	When the movement keys are used in combination with a delete or change
 	operator, the <EOL> also counts for a character.  This makes "3h"
 	different from "3dh" when the cursor crosses the end of a line.  This
 	is also true for "x" and "X", because they do the same as "dl" and
 	"dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
 	":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the
 	cursor.
 	When `'l'`  is included and it is used after an operator at the end of a
 	line (not an empty line) then it will not move to the next line.  This
 	makes "dl", "cl", "yl" etc. work normally.

# vim.opt.wildmenu

 `'wildmenu'`  `'wmnu'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	When `'wildmenu'`  is on, command-line completion operates in an enhanced
 	mode.  On pressing `'wildchar'`  (usually <Tab>) to invoke completion,
 	the possible matches are shown.
 	When `'wildoptions'`  contains "pum", then the completion matches are
 	shown in a popup menu.  Otherwise they are displayed just above the
 	command line, with the first match highlighted (overwriting the status
 	line, if there is one).
 	Keys that show the previous/next match, such as <Tab> or
 	CTRL-P/CTRL-N, cause the highlight to move to the appropriate match.
 	`'wildmode'`  must specify "full": "longest" and "list" do not start
 	`'wildmenu'`  mode. You can check the current mode with |wildmenumode()|.
 	The menu is cancelled when a key is hit that is not used for selecting
 	a completion.
 
 	While the menu is active these keys have special meanings:
 
 	CTRL-Y		- accept the currently selected match and stop
 			  completion.
 	CTRL-E		- end completion, go back to what was there before
 			  selecting a match.
 	<Left> <Right>	- select previous/next match (like CTRL-P/CTRL-N)
 	<Down>		- in filename/menu name completion: move into a
 			  subdirectory or submenu.
 	<CR>		- in menu completion, when the cursor is just after a
 			  dot: move into a submenu.
 	<Up>		- in filename/menu name completion: move up into
 			  parent directory or parent menu.
 
 	If you want <Left> and <Right> to move the cursor instead of selecting
 	a different match, use this: >
 		:cnoremap <Left> <Space><BS><Left>
 		:cnoremap <Right> <Space><BS><Right>
 <
 	|hl-WildMenu| highlights the current match.

# vim.opt.wildmode

 `'wildmode'`  `'wim'` 	string	(default: "full")
 			global
 	Completion mode that is used for the character specified with
 	`'wildchar'` .  It is a comma-separated list of up to four parts.  Each
 	part specifies what to do for each consecutive use of `'wildchar'` .  The
 	first part specifies the behavior for the first use of `'wildchar'` ,
 	The second part for the second use, etc.
 
 	Each part consists of a colon separated list consisting of the
 	following possible values:
 	""		Complete only the first match.
 	"full"		Complete the next full match.  After the last match,
 			the original string is used and then the first match
 			again.  Will also start `'wildmenu'`  if it is enabled.
 	"longest"	Complete till longest common string.  If this doesn't
 			result in a longer string, use the next part.
 	"list"		When more than one match, list all matches.
 	"lastused"	When completing buffer names and more than one buffer
 			matches, sort buffers by time last used (other than
 			the current buffer).
 	When there is only a single match, it is fully completed in all cases.
 
 	Examples of useful colon-separated values:
 	"longest:full"	Like "longest", but also start `'wildmenu'`  if it is
 			enabled.  Will not complete to the next full match.
 	"list:full"	When more than one match, list all matches and
 			complete first match.
 	"list:longest"	When more than one match, list all matches and
 			complete till longest common string.
 	"list:lastused" When more than one buffer matches, list all matches
 			and sort buffers by time last used (other than the
 			current buffer).
 
 	Examples: >
 		:set wildmode=full
 <	Complete first full match, next match, etc.  (the default) >
 		:set wildmode=longest,full
 <	Complete longest common string, then each full match >
 		:set wildmode=list:full
 <	List all matches and complete each full match >
 		:set wildmode=list,full
 <	List all matches without completing, then each full match >
 		:set wildmode=longest,list
 <	Complete longest common string, then list alternatives.

# vim.opt.wildoptions

 `'wildoptions'`  `'wop'` 	string	(default "pum,tagfile")
 			global
 	A list of words that change how |cmdline-completion| is done.
 	The following values are supported:
 	  fuzzy		Use |fuzzy-matching| to find completion matches. When
 			this value is specified, wildcard expansion will not
 			be used for completion.  The matches will be sorted by
 			the "best match" rather than alphabetically sorted.
 			This will find more matches than the wildcard
 			expansion. Currently fuzzy matching based completion
 			is not supported for file and directory names and
 			instead wildcard expansion is used.
 	  pum		Display the completion matches using the popup menu
 			in the same style as the |ins-completion-menu|.
 	  tagfile	When using CTRL-D to list matching tags, the kind of
 			tag and the file of the tag is listed.	Only one match
 			is displayed per line.  Often used tag kinds are:

 				f	function

# vim.opt.wrapmargin

 `'wrapmargin'`  `'wm'` 	number	(default 0)
 			local to buffer
 	Number of characters from the right window border where wrapping
 	starts.  When typing text beyond this limit, an <EOL> will be inserted
 	and inserting continues on the next line.
 	Options that add a margin, such as `'number'`  and `'foldcolumn'` , cause
 	the text width to be further reduced.
 	When `'textwidth'`  is non-zero, this option is not used.
 	See also `'formatoptions'`  and |ins-textwidth|.

# vim.opt.write

 `'write'` 			boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Allows writing files.  When not set, writing a file is not allowed.
 	Can be used for a view-only mode, where modifications to the text are
 	still allowed.  Can be reset with the |-m| or |-M| command line
 	argument.  Filtering text is still possible, even though this requires
 	writing a temporary file.

# vim.opt.writebackup

 `'writebackup'`  `'wb'` 	boolean	(default on)
 			global
 	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  The backup is removed after
 	the file was successfully written, unless the `'backup'`  option is
 	also on.
 	WARNING: Switching this option off means that when Vim fails to write
 	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
 	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only reset
 	this option if your file system is almost full and it makes the write
 	fail (and make sure not to exit Vim until the write was successful).
 	See |backup-table| for another explanation.
 	When the `'backupskip'`  pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
 	Depending on `'backupcopy'`  the backup is a new file or the original
 	file renamed (and a new file is written).

## arabic


```lua
boolean
```

 `'arabic'`  `'arab'` 		boolean (default off)
 			local to window
 	This option can be set to start editing Arabic text.
 	Setting this option will:
 	- Set the `'rightleft'`  option, unless `'termbidi'`  is set.
 	- Set the `'arabicshape'`  option, unless `'termbidi'`  is set.
 	- Set the `'keymap'`  option to "arabic"; in Insert mode CTRL-^ toggles
 	  between typing English and Arabic key mapping.
 	- Set the `'delcombine'`  option
 
 	Resetting this option will:
 	- Reset the `'rightleft'`  option.
 	- Disable the use of `'keymap'`  (without changing its value).
 	Note that `'arabicshape'`  and `'delcombine'`  are not reset (it is a global
 	option).
 	Also see |arabic.txt|.

## breakindent


```lua
boolean
```

 `'breakindent'`  `'bri'` 	boolean (default off)
 			local to window
 	Every wrapped line will continue visually indented (same amount of
 	space as the beginning of that line), thus preserving horizontal blocks
 	of text.

## breakindentopt


```lua
string
```

 `'breakindentopt'`  `'briopt'`  string (default empty)
 			local to window
 	Settings for `'breakindent'` . It can consist of the following optional
 	items and must be separated by a comma:
 		min:{n}	    Minimum text width that will be kept after
 			    applying `'breakindent'` , even if the resulting
 			    text should normally be narrower. This prevents
 			    text indented almost to the right window border
 			    occupying lot of vertical space when broken.
 			    (default: 20)
 		shift:{n}   After applying `'breakindent'` , the wrapped line's
 			    beginning will be shifted by the given number of
 			    characters.  It permits dynamic French paragraph
 			    indentation (negative) or emphasizing the line
 			    continuation (positive).
 			    (default: 0)
 		sbr	    Display the `'showbreak'`  value before applying the
 			    additional indent.
 			    (default: off)
 		list:{n}    Adds an additional indent for lines that match a
 			    numbered or bulleted list (using the
 			    `'formatlistpat'`  setting).
 		list:-1	    Uses the length of a match with `'formatlistpat'` 
 			    for indentation.
 			    (default: 0)
 		column:{n}  Indent at column {n}. Will overrule the other
 			    sub-options. Note: an additional indent may be
 			    added for the `'showbreak'`  setting.
 			    (default: off)

## cole


```lua
integer
```

## colorcolumn


```lua
string
```

 `'colorcolumn'`  `'cc'` 	string	(default "")
 			local to window
 	`'colorcolumn'`  is a comma-separated list of screen columns that are
 	highlighted with ColorColumn |hl-ColorColumn|.  Useful to align
 	text.  Will make screen redrawing slower.
 	The screen column can be an absolute number, or a number preceded with
 	`'+'`  or `'-'` , which is added to or subtracted from `'textwidth'` . >
 
 		:set cc=+1  " highlight column after `'textwidth'` 
 		:set cc=+1,+2,+3  " highlight three columns after `'textwidth'` 
 		:hi ColorColumn ctermbg=lightgrey guibg=lightgrey
 <
 	When `'textwidth'`  is zero then the items with `'-'`  and `'+'`  are not used.
 	A maximum of 256 columns are highlighted.

## concealcursor


```lua
string
```

 `'concealcursor'`  `'cocu'` 	string (default: "")
 			local to window
 	Sets the modes in which text in the cursor line can also be concealed.
 	When the current mode is listed then concealing happens just like in
 	other lines.
 	  n		Normal mode
 	  v		Visual mode
 	  i		Insert mode
 	  c		Command line editing, for `'incsearch'` 
 
 	`'v'`  applies to all lines in the Visual area, not only the cursor.
 	A useful value is "nc".  This is used in help files.  So long as you
 	are moving around text is concealed, but when starting to insert text
 	or selecting a Visual area the concealed text is displayed, so that
 	you can see what you are doing.
 	Keep in mind that the cursor position is not always where it's
 	displayed.  E.g., when moving vertically it may change column.

## conceallevel


```lua
integer
```

 `'conceallevel'`  `'cole'` 	number (default 0)
 			local to window
 	Determine how text with the "conceal" syntax attribute |:syn-conceal|
 	is shown:
 
 	Value		Effect ~
 	0		Text is shown normally
 	1		Each block of concealed text is replaced with one
 			character.  If the syntax item does not have a custom
 			replacement character defined (see |:syn-cchar|) the
 			character defined in `'listchars'`  is used.
 			It is highlighted with the "Conceal" highlight group.
 	2		Concealed text is completely hidden unless it has a
 			custom replacement character defined (see
 			|:syn-cchar|).
 	3		Concealed text is completely hidden.
 
 	Note: in the cursor line concealed text is not hidden, so that you can
 	edit and copy the text.  This can be changed with the `'concealcursor'` 
 	option.

## crb

boolean
```

## cuc


```lua
boolean

boolean
```

## culopt


```lua
string
```

## cursorbind


```lua
boolean
```

 `'cursorbind'`  `'crb'` 	boolean  (default off)
 			local to window
 	When this option is set, as the cursor in the current
 	window moves other cursorbound windows (windows that also have
 	this option set) move their cursors to the corresponding line and
 	column.  This option is useful for viewing the
 	differences between two versions of a file (see `'diff'` ); in diff mode,
 	inserted and deleted lines (though not characters within a line) are
 	taken into account.

## cursorcolumn


```lua
boolean
```

 `'cursorcolumn'`  `'cuc'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Highlight the screen column of the cursor with CursorColumn
 	|hl-CursorColumn|.  Useful to align text.  Will make screen redrawing
 	slower.
 	If you only want the highlighting in the current window you can use
 	these autocommands: >
 		au WinLeave * set nocursorline nocursorcolumn
 		au WinEnter * set cursorline cursorcolumn
 <

## cursorline


```lua
boolean
```

 `'cursorline'`  `'cul'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Highlight the text line of the cursor with CursorLine |hl-CursorLine|.
 	Useful to easily spot the cursor.  Will make screen redrawing slower.
 	When Visual mode is active the highlighting isn't used to make it
 	easier to see the selected text.

## cursorlineopt


```lua
string
```

 `'cursorlineopt'`  `'culopt'`  string (default: "number,line")
 			local to window
 	Comma-separated list of settings for how `'cursorline'`  is displayed.
 	Valid values:
 	"line"		Highlight the text line of the cursor with
 			CursorLine |hl-CursorLine|.
 	"screenline"	Highlight only the screen line of the cursor with
 			CursorLine |hl-CursorLine|.
 	"number"	Highlight the line number of the cursor with
 			CursorLineNr |hl-CursorLineNr|.
 
 	Special value:
 	"both"		Alias for the values "line,number".
 
 	"line" and "screenline" cannot be used together.

## diff


```lua
boolean
```

 `'diff'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Join the current window in the group of windows that shows differences
 	between files.  See |diff-mode|.

## fillchars


```lua
string
```

 `'fillchars'`  `'fcs'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Characters to fill the statuslines, vertical separators and special
 	lines in the window.
 	It is a comma-separated list of items.  Each item has a name, a colon
 	and the value of that item:
 
 	  item		default		Used for ~
 	  stl		' ' or `'^'` 	statusline of the current window
 	  stlnc		' ' or `'='` 	statusline of the non-current windows
 	  wbr		' '		window bar
 	  horiz		`'─'`  or `'-'` 	horizontal separators |:split|
 	  horizup	`'┴'`  or `'-'` 	upwards facing horizontal separator
 	  horizdown	`'┬'`  or `'-'` 	downwards facing horizontal separator
 	  vert		`'│'`  or `'|'` 	vertical separators |:vsplit|
 	  vertleft	`'┤'`  or `'|'` 	left facing vertical separator
 	  vertright	`'├'`  or `'|'` 	right facing vertical separator
 	  verthoriz	`'┼'`  or `'+'` 	overlapping vertical and horizontal
 					separator
 	  fold		`'·'`  or `'-'` 	filling `'foldtext'` 
 	  foldopen	`'-'` 		mark the beginning of a fold
 	  foldclose	`'+'` 		show a closed fold
 	  foldsep	`'│'`  or `'|'`       open fold middle marker
 	  diff		`'-'` 		deleted lines of the `'diff'`  option
 	  msgsep	' '		message separator `'display'` 
 	  eob		`'~'` 		empty lines at the end of a buffer
 	  lastline	`'@'` 		`'display'`  contains lastline/truncate
 
 	Any one that is omitted will fall back to the default.  For "stl" and
 	"stlnc" the space will be used when there is highlighting, `'^'`  or `'='` 
 	otherwise.
 
 	Note that "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown", "vertleft", "vertright" and
 	"verthoriz" are only used when `'laststatus'`  is 3, since only vertical
 	window separators are used otherwise.
 
 	If `'ambiwidth'`  is "double" then "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown",
 	"vert", "vertleft", "vertright", "verthoriz", "foldsep" and "fold"
 	default to single-byte alternatives.
 
 	Example: >
 	    :set fillchars=stl:^,stlnc:=,vert:│,fold:·,diff:-
 <	This is similar to the default, except that these characters will also
 	be used when there is highlighting.
 
 	For the "stl", "stlnc", "foldopen", "foldclose" and "foldsep" items
 	single-byte and multibyte characters are supported.  But double-width
 	characters are not supported.
 
 	The highlighting used for these items:
 	  item		highlight group ~
 	  stl		StatusLine		|hl-StatusLine|
 	  stlnc		StatusLineNC		|hl-StatusLineNC|
 	  wbr		WinBar			|hl-WinBar| or |hl-WinBarNC|
 	  horiz		WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  horizup	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  horizdown	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  vert		WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  vertleft	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  vertright	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  verthoriz	WinSeparator		|hl-WinSeparator|
 	  fold		Folded			|hl-Folded|
 	  diff		DiffDelete		|hl-DiffDelete|
 	  eob		EndOfBuffer		|hl-EndOfBuffer|
 	  lastline	NonText			|hl-NonText|

## fml


```lua
integer
```

## fmr


```lua
string
```

## foldcolumn


```lua
string
```

 `'foldcolumn'`  `'fdc'` 	string (default "0")
 			local to window
 	When and how to draw the foldcolumn. Valid values are:
 	    "auto":       resize to the minimum amount of folds to display.
 	    "auto:[1-9]": resize to accommodate multiple folds up to the
 			  selected level
             0:            to disable foldcolumn
 	    "[1-9]":      to display a fixed number of columns
 	See |folding|.

## foldenable


```lua
boolean
```

 `'foldenable'`  `'fen'` 	boolean (default on)
 			local to window
 	When off, all folds are open.  This option can be used to quickly
 	switch between showing all text unfolded and viewing the text with
 	folds (including manually opened or closed folds).  It can be toggled
 	with the |zi| command.  The `'foldcolumn'`  will remain blank when
 	`'foldenable'`  is off.
 	This option is set by commands that create a new fold or close a fold.
 	See |folding|.

## foldexpr


```lua
string
```

 `'foldexpr'`  `'fde'` 	string (default: "0")
 			local to window
 	The expression used for when `'foldmethod'`  is "expr".  It is evaluated
 	for each line to obtain its fold level.  See |fold-expr|.
 
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the `'diff'`  option is
 	on or the `'modelineexpr'`  option is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'foldexpr'`  |textlock|.

## foldignore


```lua
string
```

 `'foldignore'`  `'fdi'` 	string (default: "#")
 			local to window
 	Used only when `'foldmethod'`  is "indent".  Lines starting with
 	characters in `'foldignore'`  will get their fold level from surrounding
 	lines.  White space is skipped before checking for this character.
 	The default "#" works well for C programs.  See |fold-indent|.

## foldlevel


```lua
integer
```

 `'foldlevel'`  `'fdl'` 	number (default: 0)
 			local to window
 	Sets the fold level: Folds with a higher level will be closed.
 	Setting this option to zero will close all folds.  Higher numbers will
 	close fewer folds.
 	This option is set by commands like |zm|, |zM| and |zR|.
 	See |fold-foldlevel|.

## foldmarker


```lua
string
```

 `'foldmarker'`  `'fmr'` 	string (default: "{{{,}}}")
 			local to window
 	The start and end marker used when `'foldmethod'`  is "marker".  There
 	must be one comma, which separates the start and end marker.  The
 	marker is a literal string (a regular expression would be too slow).
 	See |fold-marker|.

## foldmethod


```lua
string
```

 `'foldmethod'`  `'fdm'` 	string (default: "manual")
 			local to window
 	The kind of folding used for the current window.  Possible values:
 	|fold-manual|	manual	    Folds are created manually.
 	|fold-indent|	indent	    Lines with equal indent form a fold.
 	|fold-expr|	expr	    `'foldexpr'`  gives the fold level of a line.
 	|fold-marker|	marker	    Markers are used to specify folds.
 	|fold-syntax|	syntax	    Syntax highlighting items specify folds.
 	|fold-diff|	diff	    Fold text that is not changed.

## foldminlines


```lua
integer
```

 `'foldminlines'`  `'fml'` 	number (default: 1)
 			local to window
 	Sets the number of screen lines above which a fold can be displayed
 	closed.  Also for manually closed folds.  With the default value of
 	one a fold can only be closed if it takes up two or more screen lines.
 	Set to zero to be able to close folds of just one screen line.
 	Note that this only has an effect on what is displayed.  After using
 	"zc" to close a fold, which is displayed open because it's smaller
 	than `'foldminlines'` , a following "zc" may close a containing fold.

## foldnestmax


```lua
integer
```

 `'foldnestmax'`  `'fdn'` 	number (default: 20)
 			local to window
 	Sets the maximum nesting of folds for the "indent" and "syntax"
 	methods.  This avoids that too many folds will be created.  Using more
 	than 20 doesn't work, because the internal limit is 20.

## foldtext


```lua
string
```

 `'foldtext'`  `'fdt'` 	string (default: "foldtext()")
 			local to window
 	An expression which is used to specify the text displayed for a closed
 	fold.  See |fold-foldtext|.
 
 	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
 	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'foldtext'`  |textlock|.

## lbr


```lua
boolean
```

## lcs


```lua
string
```

## linebreak


```lua
boolean
```

 `'linebreak'`  `'lbr'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	If on, Vim will wrap long lines at a character in `'breakat'`  rather
 	than at the last character that fits on the screen.  Unlike
 	`'wrapmargin'`  and `'textwidth'` , this does not insert <EOL>s in the file,
 	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.
 	If `'breakindent'`  is set, line is visually indented. Then, the value
 	of `'showbreak'`  is used to put in front of wrapped lines. This option
 	is not used when the `'wrap'`  option is off.
 	Note that <Tab> characters after an <EOL> are mostly not displayed
 	with the right amount of white space.

## list


```lua
boolean
```

 `'list'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	List mode: By default, show tabs as ">", trailing spaces as "-", and
 	non-breakable space characters as "+". Useful to see the difference
 	between tabs and spaces and for trailing blanks. Further changed by
 	the `'listchars'`  option.
 
 	The cursor is displayed at the start of the space a Tab character
 	occupies, not at the end as usual in Normal mode.  To get this cursor
 	position while displaying Tabs with spaces, use: >
 		:set list lcs=tab:\ \
 <
 	Note that list mode will also affect formatting (set with `'textwidth'` 
 	or `'wrapmargin'` ) when `'cpoptions'`  includes `'L'` .  See `'listchars'`  for
 	changing the way tabs are displayed.

## listchars


```lua
string
```

 `'listchars'`  `'lcs'` 	string	(default: "tab:> ,trail:-,nbsp:+")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Strings to use in `'list'`  mode and for the |:list| command.  It is a
 	comma-separated list of string settings.
 
 
 	  eol:c		Character to show at the end of each line.  When
 			omitted, there is no extra character at the end of the
 			line.
 
 	  tab:xy[z]	Two or three characters to be used to show a tab.
 			The third character is optional.
 
 	  tab:xy	The `'x'`  is always used, then `'y'`  as many times as will
 			fit.  Thus "tab:>-" displays: >
 				>
 				>-
 				>--
 				etc.
 <
 	  tab:xyz	The `'z'`  is always used, then `'x'`  is prepended, and
 			then `'y'`  is used as many times as will fit.  Thus
 			"tab:<->" displays: >
 				>
 				<>
 				<->
 				<-->
 				etc.
 <
 			When "tab:" is omitted, a tab is shown as ^I.
 
 	  space:c	Character to show for a space.  When omitted, spaces
 			are left blank.
 
 	  multispace:c...
 			One or more characters to use cyclically to show for
 			multiple consecutive spaces.  Overrides the "space"
 			setting, except for single spaces.  When omitted, the
 			"space" setting is used.  For example,
 			`:set listchars=multispace:---+` shows ten consecutive
 			spaces as: >
 				---+---+--
 <
 
 	  lead:c	Character to show for leading spaces.  When omitted,
 			leading spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
 			"multispace" settings for leading spaces.  You can
 			combine it with "tab:", for example: >
 				:set listchars+=tab:>-,lead:.
 <
 
 	  leadmultispace:c...
 			Like the |lcs-multispace| value, but for leading
 			spaces only.  Also overrides |lcs-lead| for leading
 			multiple spaces.
 			`:set listchars=leadmultispace:---+` shows ten
 			consecutive leading spaces as: >
 				---+---+--XXX
 <
 			Where "XXX" denotes the first non-blank characters in
 			the line.
 
 	  trail:c	Character to show for trailing spaces.  When omitted,
 			trailing spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
 			"multispace" settings for trailing spaces.
 
 	  extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when `'wrap'`  is
 			off and the line continues beyond the right of the
 			screen.
 
 	  precedes:c	Character to show in the first visible column of the
 			physical line, when there is text preceding the
 			character visible in the first column.
 
 	  conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
 			`'conceallevel'`  is set to 1.  A space when omitted.
 
 	  nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space character
 			(0xA0 (160 decimal) and U+202F).  Left blank when
 			omitted.
 
 	The characters `':'`  and `','`  should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can
 	be used.  All characters must be single width.
 
 	Each character can be specified as hex: >
 		set listchars=eol:\\x24
 		set listchars=eol:\\u21b5
 		set listchars=eol:\\U000021b5
 <	Note that a double backslash is used.  The number of hex characters
 	must be exactly 2 for \\x, 4 for \\u and 8 for \\U.
 
 	Examples: >
 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,trail:-
 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,eol:<,nbsp:%
 	    :set lcs=extends:>,precedes:<
 <	|hl-NonText| highlighting will be used for "eol", "extends" and
 	"precedes". |hl-Whitespace| for "nbsp", "space", "tab", "multispace",
 	"lead" and "trail".

## nu


```lua
boolean
```

## number


```lua
boolean
```

 `'number'`  `'nu'` 		boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Print the line number in front of each line.  When the `'n'`  option is
 	excluded from `'cpoptions'`  a wrapped line will not use the column of
 	line numbers.
 	Use the `'numberwidth'`  option to adjust the room for the line number.
 	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, `'-'` 
 	characters are put before the number.
 	For highlighting see |hl-LineNr|, |hl-CursorLineNr|, and the
 	|:sign-define| "numhl" argument.
 
 	The `'relativenumber'`  option changes the displayed number to be
 	relative to the cursor.  Together with `'number'`  there are these
 	four combinations (cursor in line 3):
 
 		`'nonu'`           `'nu'`             `'nonu'`           `'nu'` 
 		`'nornu'`          `'nornu'`          `'rnu'`            `'rnu'`

## numberwidth


```lua
integer
```

 `'numberwidth'`  `'nuw'` 	number	(default: 4)
 			local to window
 	Minimal number of columns to use for the line number.  Only relevant
 	when the `'number'`  or `'relativenumber'`  option is set or printing lines
 	with a line number. Since one space is always between the number and
 	the text, there is one less character for the number itself.
 	The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to
 	fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of
 	rows in the window, depending on whether `'number'`  or `'relativenumber'` 
 	is set. Thus with the Vim default of 4 there is room for a line number
 	up to 999. When the buffer has 1000 lines five columns will be used.
 	The minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 20.

## nuw


```lua
integer
```

## previewwindow


```lua
boolean
```

 `'previewwindow'`  `'pvw'` 	boolean (default off)
 			local to window
 	Identifies the preview window.  Only one window can have this option
 	set.  It's normally not set directly, but by using one of the commands
 	|:ptag|, |:pedit|, etc.

## pvw


```lua
boolean
```

## relativenumber


```lua
boolean
```

 `'relativenumber'`  `'rnu'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of
 	each line. Relative line numbers help you use the |count| you can
 	precede some vertical motion commands (e.g. j k + -) with, without
 	having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
 	other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
 	When the `'n'`  option is excluded from `'cpoptions'`  a wrapped
 	line will not use the column of line numbers.
 	The `'numberwidth'`  option can be used to set the room used for the line
 	number.
 	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, `'-'` 
 	characters are put before the number.
 	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
 	the number.
 
 	The number in front of the cursor line also depends on the value of
 	`'number'` , see |number_relativenumber| for all combinations of the two
 	options.

## rightleft


```lua
boolean
```

 `'rightleft'`  `'rl'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	When on, display orientation becomes right-to-left, i.e., characters
 	that are stored in the file appear from the right to the left.
 	Using this option, it is possible to edit files for languages that
 	are written from the right to the left such as Hebrew and Arabic.
 	This option is per window, so it is possible to edit mixed files
 	simultaneously, or to view the same file in both ways (this is
 	useful whenever you have a mixed text file with both right-to-left
 	and left-to-right strings so that both sets are displayed properly
 	in different windows).  Also see |rileft.txt|.

## rightleftcmd


```lua
string
```

 `'rightleftcmd'`  `'rlc'` 	string	(default "search")
 			local to window
 	Each word in this option enables the command line editing to work in
 	right-to-left mode for a group of commands:
 
 		search		"/" and "?" commands
 
 	This is useful for languages such as Hebrew, Arabic and Farsi.
 	The `'rightleft'`  option must be set for `'rightleftcmd'`  to take effect.

## rl


```lua
boolean
```

## rlc


```lua
string
```

## rnu


```lua
boolean
```

## sbr


```lua
string
```

## scb


```lua
boolean
```

## scl


```lua
string
```

## scr


```lua
integer
```

## scroll


```lua
integer
```

 `'scroll'`  `'scr'` 		number	(default: half the window height)
 			local to window
 	Number of lines to scroll with CTRL-U and CTRL-D commands.  Will be
 	set to half the number of lines in the window when the window size
 	changes.  This may happen when enabling the |status-line| or
 	`'tabline'`  option after setting the `'scroll'`  option.
 	If you give a count to the CTRL-U or CTRL-D command it will
 	be used as the new value for `'scroll'` .  Reset to half the window
 	height with ":set scroll=0".

## scrollbind


```lua
boolean
```

 `'scrollbind'`  `'scb'` 	boolean  (default off)
 			local to window
 	See also |scroll-binding|.  When this option is set, the current
 	window scrolls as other scrollbind windows (windows that also have
 	this option set) scroll.  This option is useful for viewing the
 	differences between two versions of a file, see `'diff'` .
 	See |`'scrollopt'` | for options that determine how this option should be
 	interpreted.
 	This option is mostly reset when splitting a window to edit another
 	file.  This means that ":split | edit file" results in two windows
 	with scroll-binding, but ":split file" does not.

## scrolloff


```lua
integer
```

 `'scrolloff'`  `'so'` 	number	(default 0)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
 	This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
 	you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
 	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
 	when long lines wrap).
 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
 	these two: >
 		setlocal scrolloff<
 		setlocal scrolloff=-1
 <	For scrolling horizontally see `'sidescrolloff'` .

## showbreak


```lua
string
```

 `'showbreak'`  `'sbr'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	String to put at the start of lines that have been wrapped.  Useful
 	values are "> " or "+++ ": >
 		:set showbreak=>\
 <	Note the backslash to escape the trailing space.  It's easier like
 	this: >
 		:let &showbreak = '+++ '
 <	Only printable single-cell characters are allowed, excluding <Tab> and
 	comma (in a future version the comma might be used to separate the
 	part that is shown at the end and at the start of a line).
 	The |hl-NonText| highlight group determines the highlighting.
 	Note that tabs after the showbreak will be displayed differently.
 	If you want the `'showbreak'`  to appear in between line numbers, add the
 	"n" flag to `'cpoptions'` .
 	A window-local value overrules a global value.  If the global value is
 	set and you want no value in the current window use NONE: >
 		:setlocal showbreak=NONE
 <

## sidescrolloff


```lua
integer
```

 `'sidescrolloff'`  `'siso'` 	number (default 0)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	The minimal number of screen columns to keep to the left and to the
 	right of the cursor if `'nowrap'`  is set.  Setting this option to a
 	value greater than 0 while having |`'sidescroll'` | also at a non-zero
 	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
 	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
 	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
 	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too
 	close to the beginning of the line.
 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
 	these two: >
 		setlocal sidescrolloff<
 		setlocal sidescrolloff=-1
 <
 	Example: Try this together with `'sidescroll'`  and `'listchars'`  as
 		 in the following example to never allow the cursor to move
 		 onto the "extends" character: >
 
 		 :set nowrap sidescroll=1 listchars=extends:>,precedes:<
 		 :set sidescrolloff=1
 <

## signcolumn


```lua
string
```

 `'signcolumn'`  `'scl'` 	string	(default "auto")
 			local to window
 	When and how to draw the signcolumn. Valid values are:
 	   "auto"	only when there is a sign to display
 	   "auto:[1-9]" resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
 	                given number (maximum 9), e.g. "auto:4"
 	   "auto:[1-8]-[2-9]"
 	                resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
 			given maximum number (maximum 9) while keeping
 			at least the given minimum (maximum 8) fixed
 			space. The minimum number should always be less
 			than the maximum number, e.g. "auto:2-5"
 	   "no"		never
 	   "yes"	always
 	   "yes:[1-9]"  always, with fixed space for signs up to the given
 	                number (maximum 9), e.g. "yes:3"
 	   "number"	display signs in the `'number'`  column. If the number
 			column is not present, then behaves like "auto".
 
 	Note regarding "orphaned signs": with signcolumn numbers higher than
 	1, deleting lines will also remove the associated signs automatically,
 	in contrast to the default Vim behavior of keeping and grouping them.
 	This is done in order for the signcolumn appearance not appear weird
 	during line deletion.

## siso


```lua
integer
```

## so


```lua
integer
```

## spell


```lua
boolean
```

 `'spell'` 			boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	When on spell checking will be done.  See |spell|.
 	The languages are specified with `'spelllang'` .

## statuscolumn


```lua
string
```

 `'statuscolumn'`  `'stc'` 	string	(default: empty)
 			local to window
 	EXPERIMENTAL
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the area to the
 	side of a window, normally containing the fold, sign and number columns.
 	The format of this option is like that of `'statusline'` .
 
 	Some of the items from the `'statusline'`  format are different for
 	`'statuscolumn'` :
 
 	%l	line number of currently drawn line
 	%r	relative line number of currently drawn line
 	%s	sign column for currently drawn line
 	%C	fold column for currently drawn line
 
 	NOTE: To draw the sign and fold columns, their items must be included in
 	`'statuscolumn'` . Even when they are not included, the status column width
 	will adapt to the `'signcolumn'`  and `'foldcolumn'`  width.
 
 	The |v:lnum|    variable holds the line number to be drawn.
 	The |v:relnum|  variable holds the relative line number to be drawn.
 	The |v:virtnum| variable is negative when drawing virtual lines, zero
 		      when drawing the actual buffer line, and positive when
 		      drawing the wrapped part of a buffer line.
 
 	NOTE: The %@ click execute function item is supported as well but the
 	specified function will be the same for each row in the same column.
 	It cannot be switched out through a dynamic `'statuscolumn'`  format, the
 	handler should be written with this in mind.
 
 	Examples: >vim
 		" Relative number with bar separator and click handlers:
 		:set statuscolumn=%@SignCb@%s%=%T%@NumCb@%r│%T
 
 		" Right aligned relative cursor line number:
 		:let &stc='%=%{v:relnum?v:relnum:v:lnum} '
 
 		" Line numbers in hexadecimal for non wrapped part of lines:
 		:let &stc='%=%{v:virtnum>0?"":printf("%x",v:lnum)} '
 
 		" Human readable line numbers with thousands separator:
 		:let &stc=`'%{substitute(v:lnum,"\\d\\zs\\ze\\'` 
 			   . `'%(\\d\\d\\d\\)\\+$",",","g")}'` 
 
 		" Both relative and absolute line numbers with different
 		" highlighting for odd and even relative numbers:
 		:let &stc=`'%#NonText#%{&nu?v:lnum:""}'`  .
 		 '%=%{&rnu&&(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}' .
 		 '%#LineNr#%{&rnu&&!(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}'
 
 <	WARNING: this expression is evaluated for each screen line so defining
 	an expensive expression can negatively affect render performance.

## statusline


```lua
string
```

 `'statusline'`  `'stl'` 	string	(default empty)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the status line.
 	Also see |status-line|.
 
 	The option consists of printf style `'%'`  items interspersed with
 	normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
 	  %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
 	All fields except the {item} are optional.  A single percent sign can
 	be given as "%%".
 
 	When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
 	evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example: >
 		:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
 <	The  variable will be set to the |window-ID| of the
 	window that the status line belongs to.
 	The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
 	Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
 	current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
 	context of the window that the statusline belongs to.
 
 	When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
 	empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.
 	When the result contains unprintable characters the result is
 	unpredictable.
 
 	Note that the only effect of `'ruler'`  when this option is set (and
 	`'laststatus'`  is 2 or 3) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.
 
 	field	    meaning ~
 	-	    Left justify the item.  The default is right justified
 		    when minwid is larger than the length of the item.
 	0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by "-".
 	minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by "-" & "0".
 		    Value must be 50 or less.
 	maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a "<"
 		    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be
 		    shifted down to maxwid-2 digits followed by ">"number
 		    where number is the amount of missing digits, much like
 		    an exponential notation.
 	item	    A one letter code as described below.
 
 	Following is a description of the possible statusline items.  The
 	second character in "item" is the type:
 		N for number
 		S for string
 		F for flags as described below
 		- not applicable
 
 	item  meaning ~
 	f S   Path to the file in the buffer, as typed or relative to current
 	      directory.
 	F S   Full path to the file in the buffer.
 	t S   File name (tail) of file in the buffer.
 	m F   Modified flag, text is "[+]"; "[-]" if `'modifiable'`  is off.
 	M F   Modified flag, text is ",+" or ",-".
 	r F   Readonly flag, text is "[RO]".
 	R F   Readonly flag, text is ",RO".
 	h F   Help buffer flag, text is "[help]".
 	H F   Help buffer flag, text is ",HLP".
 	w F   Preview window flag, text is "[Preview]".
 	W F   Preview window flag, text is ",PRV".
 	y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., "[vim]".  See `'filetype'` .
 	Y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., ",VIM".  See `'filetype'` .
 	q S   "[Quickfix List]", "[Location List]" or empty.
 	k S   Value of "b:keymap_name" or `'keymap'`  when |:lmap| mappings are
 	      being used: "<keymap>"
 	n N   Buffer number.
 	b N   Value of character under cursor.
 	B N   As above, in hexadecimal.
 	o N   Byte number in file of byte under cursor, first byte is 1.
 	      Mnemonic: Offset from start of file (with one added)
 	O N   As above, in hexadecimal.
 	l N   Line number.
 	L N   Number of lines in buffer.
 	c N   Column number (byte index).
 	v N   Virtual column number (screen column).
 	V N   Virtual column number as -{num}.  Not displayed if equal to `'c'` .
 	p N   Percentage through file in lines as in |CTRL-G|.
 	P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the
 	      percentage described for `'ruler'` .  Always 3 in length, unless
 	      translated.
 	S S   `'showcmd'`  content, see `'showcmdloc'` .
 	a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
 	      Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
 	{ NF  Evaluate expression between "%{" and "}" and substitute result.
 	      Note that there is no "%" before the closing "}".  The
 	      expression cannot contain a "}" character, call a function to
 	      work around that.  See |stl-%{| below.
 	`{%` -  This is almost same as "{" except the result of the expression is
 	      re-evaluated as a statusline format string.  Thus if the
 	      return value of expr contains "%" items they will get expanded.
 	      The expression can contain the "}" character, the end of
 	      expression is denoted by "%}".
 	      For example: >
 		func! Stl_filename() abort
 		    return "%t"
 		endfunc
 <	        `stl=%{Stl_filename()}`   results in `"%t"`
 	        `stl=%{%Stl_filename()%}` results in `"Name of current file"`
 	%} -  End of "{%" expression
 	( -   Start of item group.  Can be used for setting the width and
 	      alignment of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
 	) -   End of item group.  No width fields allowed.
 	T N   For `'tabline'` : start of tab page N label.  Use %T or %X to end
 	      the label.  Clicking this label with left mouse button switches
 	      to the specified tab page.
 	X N   For `'tabline'` : start of close tab N label.  Use %X or %T to end
 	      the label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current
 	      tab" label.    Clicking this label with left mouse button closes
 	      specified tab page.
 	@ N   Start of execute function label. Use %X or %T to
 	      end the label, e.g.: %10@SwitchBuffer@foo.c%X.  Clicking this
 	      label runs specified function: in the example when clicking once
 	      using left mouse button on "foo.c" "SwitchBuffer(10, 1, `'l'` ,
 	      '    ')" expression will be run.  Function receives the
 	      following arguments in order:
 	      1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
 	      2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
 	      3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle
 	         button respectively; one should not rely on third argument
 	         being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value
 	         that contains only ASCII lower case letters may be expected
 	         for other mouse buttons
 	      4. modifiers pressed: string which contains "s" if shift
 	         modifier was pressed, "c" for control, "a" for alt and "m"
 	         for meta; currently if modifier is not pressed string
 	         contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence
 	         of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use |stridx()| to
 	         test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed
 	         to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per
 	         modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence
 	         is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was
 	         added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on
 	         this label.
 	      Use |getmousepos()|.winid in the specified function to get the
 	      corresponding window id of the clicked item.
 	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
 	      No width fields allowed.
 	= -   Separation point between alignment sections.  Each section will
 	      be separated by an equal number of spaces.  With one %= what
 	      comes after it will be right-aligned.  With two %= there is a
 	      middle part, with white space left and right of it.
 	      No width fields allowed.
 	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
 	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
 	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
 	      windows.
 	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
 	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
 	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine will be applied to
 	      StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
 	      The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|
 
 	When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
 	that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
 	when flags are used like in the examples below.
 
 	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
 	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
 	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
 	completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
 		:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
 <	Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
 	line is displayed.
 
 	While evaluating %{} the current buffer and current window will be set
 	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
 	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
 	The variable "g:actual_curbuf" is set to the `bufnr()` number of the
 	real current buffer and "g:actual_curwin" to the |window-ID| of the
 	real current window.  These values are strings.
 
 	The `'statusline'`  option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
 	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
 
 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
 	evaluating `'statusline'`  |textlock|.
 
 	If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
 	a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
 	using `:redrawstatus`.
 
 	A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
 	Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
 	described above.
 
 	Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
 	If you are stuck, hold down `':'`  or `'Q'`  to get a prompt, then quit and
 	edit your vimrc or whatever with "vim --clean" to get it right.
 
 	Examples:
 	Emulate standard status line with `'ruler'`  set >

## virtualedit


```lua
string
```

 `'virtualedit'`  `'ve'` 	string	(default "")
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	A comma-separated list of these words:
 	    block	Allow virtual editing in Visual block mode.
 	    insert	Allow virtual editing in Insert mode.
 	    all		Allow virtual editing in all modes.
 	    onemore	Allow the cursor to move just past the end of the line
 	    none	When used as the local value, do not allow virtual
 			editing even when the global value is set.  When used
 			as the global value, "none" is the same as "".
 	    NONE	Alternative spelling of "none".
 
 	Virtual editing means that the cursor can be positioned where there is
 	no actual character.  This can be halfway into a tab or beyond the end
 	of the line.  Useful for selecting a rectangle in Visual mode and
 	editing a table.
 	"onemore" is not the same, it will only allow moving the cursor just
 	after the last character of the line.  This makes some commands more
 	consistent.  Previously the cursor was always past the end of the line
 	if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi compatible.  It may also
 	break some plugins or Vim scripts.  For example because |l| can move
 	the cursor after the last character.  Use with care!
 	Using the `$` command will move to the last character in the line, not
 	past it.  This may actually move the cursor to the left!
 	The `g$` command will move to the end of the screen line.
 	It doesn't make sense to combine "all" with "onemore", but you will
 	not get a warning for it.
 	When combined with other words, "none" is ignored.

## wbr

string

## wfh


```lua
boolean
```

## wfw


```lua
boolean
```

## winbar


```lua
string
```

 `'winbar'`  `'wbr'` 		string (default empty)
 			global or local to window |global-local|
 	When non-empty, this option enables the window bar and determines its
 	contents. The window bar is a bar that's shown at the top of every
 	window with it enabled. The value of `'winbar'`  is evaluated like with
 	`'statusline'` .
 
 	When changing something that is used in `'winbar'`  that does not trigger
 	it to be updated, use |:redrawstatus|.
 
 	Floating windows do not use the global value of `'winbar'` . The
 	window-local value of `'winbar'`  must be set for a floating window to
 	have a window bar.
 
 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.

## winbl


```lua
integer
```

## winblend


```lua
integer
```

 `'winblend'`  `'winbl'` 		number	(default 0)
 			local to window
 	Enables pseudo-transparency for a floating window. Valid values are in
 	the range of 0 for fully opaque window (disabled) to 100 for fully
 	transparent background. Values between 0-30 are typically most useful.
 
 	UI-dependent. Works best with RGB colors. `'termguicolors'` 

## winfixheight


```lua
boolean
```

 `'winfixheight'`  `'wfh'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Keep the window height when windows are opened or closed and
 	`'equalalways'`  is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.  Set by default for the
 	|preview-window| and |quickfix-window|.
 	The height may be changed anyway when running out of room.

## winfixwidth


```lua
boolean
```

 `'winfixwidth'`  `'wfw'` 	boolean	(default off)
 			local to window
 	Keep the window width when windows are opened or closed and
 	`'equalalways'`  is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.
 	The width may be changed anyway when running out of room.

## winhighlight


```lua
string
```

 `'winhighlight'`  `'winhl'` 	string (default empty)
 			local to window
 	Window-local highlights.  Comma-delimited list of highlight
 	|group-name| pairs "{hl-from}:{hl-to},..." where each {hl-from} is
 	a |highlight-groups| item to be overridden by {hl-to} group in
 	the window.
 
 	Note: highlight namespaces take precedence over `'winhighlight'` .
 	See |nvim_win_set_hl_ns()| and |nvim_set_hl()|.
 
 	Highlights of vertical separators are determined by the window to the
 	left of the separator.  The `'tabline'`  highlight of a tabpage is
 	decided by the last-focused window of the tabpage.  Highlights of
 	the popupmenu are determined by the current window.  Highlights in the
 	message area cannot be overridden.
 
 	Example: show a different color for non-current windows: >
 		set winhighlight=Normal:MyNormal,NormalNC:MyNormalNC
 <

## winhl


```lua
string
```

## wrap


```lua
boolean
```

 `'wrap'` 			boolean	(default on)
 			local to window
 	This option changes how text is displayed.  It doesn't change the text
 	in the buffer, see `'textwidth'`  for that.
 	When on, lines longer than the width of the window will wrap and
 	displaying continues on the next line.  When off lines will not wrap
 	and only part of long lines will be displayed.  When the cursor is
 	moved to a part that is not shown, the screen will scroll
 	horizontally.
 	The line will be broken in the middle of a word if necessary.  See
 	`'linebreak'`  to get the break at a word boundary.
 	To make scrolling horizontally a bit more useful, try this: >
 		:set sidescroll=5
 		:set listchars+=precedes:<,extends:>
 <	See `'sidescroll'` , `'listchars'`  and |wrap-off|.
 	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the `'diff'`  option is
 	on.
